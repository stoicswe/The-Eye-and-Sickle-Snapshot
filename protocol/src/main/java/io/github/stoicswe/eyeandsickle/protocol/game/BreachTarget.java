/**
 * Something a breach could be opened against, described well enough to decide whether to.
 *
 * <p>{@code docs/design/05-hacking-minigame.md} §2 instantiates an attempt with a target "with a
 * defense profile (firewall tier, tarpit, honeypot flag, canary tokens, ...) drawn from {@code
 * 09-defense-and-hardening.md}". This record is that profile as the <em>player</em> has it, which is
 * not the same document.
 *
 * <h2>Every defence field is recon output, not ground truth</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/07-recon-tools.md} §2 sells knowing-before-you-leap as a ladder of purchases: the
 * Passive Sniffer sees one hop, the Topology Mapper two, the Traffic Analyzer "separates live/defended
 * targets from dormant ones" and is reputation-gated precisely because "knowing which nodes are
 * <em>worth</em> hitting (and which will fight back) is economy-distorting if free". If this record
 * carried the server's truth, every one of those tools would be redundant on arrival.
 *
 * <p>So {@code firewallTier}, {@code tarpit} and {@code canaries} mean "as far as recon has
 * established", and {@code liveOrDormant} reads {@link TargetState#DORMANT} both for a target that is
 * dormant and for one nobody has analysed yet. Which is also the trap worth naming: dormant is the
 * default reading, and {@code docs/design/02-unlock-gates.md} §2.4 gives proof-of-skill credit only
 * against a live target, so an unanalysed target is one the player may work perfectly and earn no
 * unlock from.
 *
 * <h2>{@code honeypotSuspected}, never {@code isHoneypot}</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/09-defense-and-hardening.md} §1 defines the Honeypot Stash as "a decoy
 * high-hackable zone containing junk; raiders can't tell until extraction", and §2 says its function is
 * to make "casing a target unreliable, so raiding stays risky". A boolean stating the truth would
 * delete an entire reputation-gated defensive item at the point of rendering. The name carries the
 * uncertainty so nobody later "cleans it up".
 *
 * <h2>{@code minerCrack} is why this can be the safest thing in the game</h2>
 *
 * A crack is the core minigame run against a foreign miner on the player's <em>own</em> rig
 * ({@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §5.1). Invariant I9 means it generates no heat on any outcome, and
 * §5.1 makes it the game's teaching vector for exactly that reason. The estimate beside it is the
 * timing bet §5.1 describes: a buffer found at minute five holds almost nothing, one found at hour four
 * holds the cap. It is an estimate because making it exact would turn the decision into arithmetic.
 *
 * @param targetId what {@code beginBreach} takes
 * @param address where it is, as the player writes it
 * @param label what it is called
 * @param role the Enumeration banner when recon has established it; {@code ""} otherwise
 * @param difficultyTier how hard it is expected to be, on the one shared scale
 * @param liveOrDormant whether recon has established it is defended; dormant is also the not-yet-known
 *     reading
 * @param minerCrack whether this is a foreign miner on the player's own rig — no heat, whatever happens
 * @param firewallTier 0 for none, 1–3 for the tiers {@code 09} §1 publishes
 * @param tarpit whether a Tarpit is believed armed; it surcharges every action rather than the budget
 * @param canaries whether canary tokens are believed present; touching one tags the player's handle
 *     ({@code docs/design/09-defense-and-hardening.md} §2)
 * @param honeypotSuspected whether this looks like a decoy — a suspicion, never a finding
 * @param estimatedBufferWei the crack prize, estimated, in minor units; 0 for anything that is
 *     not a crack
 * @param computeCost cycles the attempt will reserve for its whole duration
 * @param available whether a breach can be opened against it right now
 * @param refusal {@code ""} when available; otherwise why not, in words
