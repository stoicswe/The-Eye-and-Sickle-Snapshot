/**
 * One block, shaped the way a block explorer shows one.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Ethereum's field names over Bitcoin's behaviour, and that is coherent rather than a mash</h2>
 *
 * The header below is modelled on <b>pre-Merge Ethereum</b>, which was itself a proof-of-work chain:
 * it had a {@code nonce}, a {@code difficulty}, a {@code miner} who took the block reward, and
 * {@code extraData} the miner chose. So "Ethereum-shaped data, Bitcoin-shaped mechanics" is not a
 * contradiction — it is roughly what Ethereum 1.0 was, and it is why this chain can carry these
 * fields without any of them being a lie.
 *
 * <p>What is deliberately <em>absent</em> is anything that would be: no contract addresses, no logs,
 * no uncles, no fee market. Every transaction here is a plain value transfer, which is exactly the
 * 21 000 gas Ethereum charges for one, so {@code gasUsed} is honest arithmetic rather than decoration.
 *
 * @param number height
 * @param hash {@code 0x} + 64 hex
 * @param parentHash the block before it — what makes this a chain
 * @param timestamp when it was found
 * @param minerLabel who found it, in words ("YOUR RIG", a pool's name, "unpooled")
 * @param minerAddress that miner's {@code 0x} + 40 hex address
 * @param yours whether this rig mined it
 * @param difficulty the target it was mined against
 * @param nonce the number the miner found, {@code 0x} + 16 hex
 * @param transactions how many transactions it carries
 * @param gasUsed 21 000 per transfer
 * @param gasLimit the block's ceiling
 * @param sizeBytes serialised size
 * @param rewardWei the subsidy the miner took
 * @param feesWei the transaction fees the miner also collected
 * @param extraData whatever the miner wrote in it
 * @param body every transaction in the block, highest fee first — empty until asked for
