/**
 * One row in the rig's process table — the manual audit, made a thing a player can actually do.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ THERE IS NO {@code rogue} FIELD, AND ADDING ONE DELETES THE FEATURE</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.1 makes manual investigation the game's second-strongest
 * tutorial vector: "the discrepancy is always present in the data". A parasite hides here by
 * <b>looking like the other rows</b>, and the only thing that gives it away is the data itself — a
 * name one character off a real daemon, a user nothing else on the machine runs as, a CPU figure that
 * does not match its accumulated CPU time, two rows claiming to be the same tool.
 *
 * <p>So this record carries what a real process table carries and nothing more. A boolean the client
 * could paint red would turn an investigation into a highlight, and every tell below into decoration.
 * The same rule that keeps {@link BreachSnapshot} from carrying the Logic code applies here, and it
 * is the reason {@link #killable} and {@link #restartable} are phrased as <em>capabilities</em>
 * rather than as kinds: they answer "what can I do to this row", which the player is allowed to know,
 * instead of "what is this row really", which they are not.
 *
 * <h2>The stats are diegetic instrumentation, and they are stable</h2>
 *
 * {@link #cpuPercent}, {@link #memoryBytes} and the four traffic counters are the machine's own
 * readouts. They are derived from real state where real state exists — a scan holding 35 cycles
 * genuinely shows as heavy CPU — and are otherwise a deterministic function of the process's identity
 * and a slow time bucket, so a row drifts the way a real one does and never jitters. A table whose
 * numbers danced would be unreadable at exactly the moment a player was trying to compare two rows,
 * which is the only moment it matters.
 *
 * @param processId what an intent names. Stable for the life of the process; never the pid, which is
 *     a display figure a player reads and a save could legitimately renumber
 * @param pid the number on screen. Small and stable for system processes, larger for anything started
 *     since boot — the ordering a real table has, and a tell in its own right
 * @param name the command, as it would appear in {@code ps}
 * @param user who it runs as. {@code root}, the player's handle, or an underscore-prefixed service
 *     account — and occasionally something that belongs to none of those families
 * @param parent what started it, for the tree a player can read down. {@code ""} for pid 1
 * @param cpuPercent share of the machine, 0–100 as a percentage figure rather than a fraction, so it
 *     reads the way Activity Monitor's column does
 * @param cpuTime accumulated processor time. ⚠ A process claiming heavy CPU with no accumulated time
 *     has not been working as long as it says it has
 * @param threads how many threads it holds
 * @param idleWakeups wakeups from idle — the column that catches a busy-loop
 * @param memoryBytes resident memory
 * @param ports mach ports held; decoration on most rows and a tell on a few
 * @param bytesRead disk read since it started
 * @param bytesWritten disk written since it started
 * @param sentBytes network out. ⚠ A local-only tool with traffic here is not local-only
 * @param rcvdBytes network in
 * @param sentPackets packets out
 * @param rcvdPackets packets in
 * @param cycles what it is costing the compute ledger, so this table and the grid can be reconciled
 *     against each other — which is the cross-check §3.1 is built on
 * @param killable whether {@code kill} is offered. False for anything the rig needs to keep running
 * @param restartable whether {@code restart} is offered instead — see the class note on system
 *     processes
 * @param detail one short line for the row's tooltip and its accessible text; never a verdict
