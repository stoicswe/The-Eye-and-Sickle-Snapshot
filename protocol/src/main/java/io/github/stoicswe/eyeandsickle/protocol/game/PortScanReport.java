/**
 * What a port scan came back with.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Every field below the scan's depth is UNKNOWN, and unknown is not zero</h2>
 *
 * A scan that stopped at {@link PortScanTarget#OS_VERSION} knows nothing about the target's vault,
 * and the readout must say so rather than print a confident {@code 0}. That is why the counts are
 * boxed as {@code -1} sentinels behind {@link #knows} rather than left as bare numbers: a panel that
 * renders "high-risk vault: 0" for a scan that never looked has told the player something false about
 * a machine they are deciding whether to rob.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The medium-vault figure is an ESTIMATE and carries its own error</h2>
 *
 * {@link #vaultMediumEstimate} is a midpoint and {@link #vaultMediumError} is the half-width around
 * it, so the honest reading is "somewhere between the two". A deeper scan narrows the band; nothing
 * ever closes it, because the middle tier is not readable from outside — that is what
 * {@code docs/design/01-core-resources.md} §6 buys with the tier. Reporting it as a count would make
 * the tier system a formality.
 *
 * @param address the machine scanned
 * @param requested what the player asked to learn — the deepest rung paid for
 * @param at when the snapshot was taken; {@link #cyclesUsed} is only true as of this instant
 * @param detected whether the target noticed
 * @param blocked whether the target refused the scan outright, in which case the findings are partial
 * @param hostName what the machine calls itself, or empty when unknown
 * @param operatorName the account that runs it, or empty when unknown
 * @param firewallTier 1–3, or -1 when unknown
 * @param osName the OS and version string, or empty when unknown
 * @param cyclesTotal the machine's capability, or -1
 * @param cyclesUsed what was busy at {@link #at}, or -1
 * @param downloadsBytes how much is in the download folder, or -1
 * @param vaultHighCount items in the exposed tier, or -1
 * @param vaultMediumEstimate midpoint of the middle tier's contents, or -1
 * @param vaultMediumError half-width of the band around it; 0 only when nothing was estimated
 * @param note what happened, in words — always present, and the only field on a blocked scan
