/**
 * One machine as the player knows it.
 *
 * <p>The name is chosen over {@code Node} or {@code Host} on purpose: this is not a machine, it is a
 * <em>report</em> of one. Everything on it is knowledge the player has paid for — with a sweep, with a
 * recon tool, or with a breach — and the discipline the whole network view rests on is that there is no
 * field here the truth could hide in. {@link BreachTarget} carries the same warning for the same reason,
 * and this record and that one are the two halves of "what recon has established": this one describes
 * where a machine sits, that one describes whether to open a breach on it.
 *
 * <h2>Undiscovered machines have no {@code Sighting}, and that is the encoding</h2>
 *
 * There is deliberately no {@code discovered} flag, and no dark or placeholder instance. A machine the
 * player has not detected is simply absent from {@link NetMap#sightings()} — the shell does not list it,
 * completion does not offer it, {@code Targets} produces no {@link BreachTarget} for it, and the graph
 * draws no cell where it is: no marker, no ellipsis, no "3 contacts nearby". Absence is the only encoding
 * of "not discovered" that cannot leak, because there is nothing to leak <em>from</em>. A boolean would
 * have put the machine's address, server and hop count on the wire and asked every renderer, forever, to
 * remember not to draw them.
 *
 * <p>{@link #kind} being {@link HostKind#UNKNOWN} is the <em>other</em> thing, and the two are worth
 * keeping straight: that is a machine the sweep did find, whose type the sweep is not licensed to name.
 * "Something is there and I do not know what" is honest and drawable; upgrading it to a named type is
 * what the 15 EC Passive Sniffer sells ({@code docs/design/07-recon-tools.md} §1).
 *
 * <h2>What is missing from this record, and why each absence is load-bearing</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>No {@code defended}, no {@code firewallTier}, no loot figure.</strong> Those reach the
 *       player through {@link BreachTarget}, which already documents them as recon output rather than
 *       truth. Duplicating them here would give the same question two answers on the same screen, and
 *       the two would drift — the interesting half of {@code liveOrDormant} is that it reads
 *       {@link TargetState#DORMANT} both for a dormant machine and for one nobody has analysed, and a
 *       second copy would eventually be built without that subtlety.
 *   <li><strong>No detection roll.</strong> Whether a sweep finds a machine is decided by a value fixed
 *       when the world is generated and compared against the instrument's sensitivity; putting it on the
 *       wire would let a client compute exactly what a better sweep would find, which is the purchase
 *       decision the upgraded sweeps exist to sell. It is also the reason re-running the same sweep is
 *       not a re-roll, and a client that could see the number would be a client that could prove it.
 *   <li><strong>No {@code honeypot}.</strong> {@link #honeypotSuspected} is a suspicion and is named as
 *       one. {@code docs/design/07-recon-tools.md} §2 requires the Honeypot Detector to keep a
 *       false-negative rate — "a perfect detector removes the fear the traps exist to create" — so a
 *       truthful boolean would delete a schematic-gated item at the point of rendering. Same discipline
 *       as {@link BreachTarget#honeypotSuspected()}; the name carries the uncertainty so nobody later
 *       "cleans it up".
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>{@code hopsFromVantage}, not hops from the rig</h2>
 *
 * Distance is measured from wherever the player is currently operating, which is what makes a one-hop
 * horizon survivable across a whole world: traversal is repositioning. Breach a machine, take a foothold,
 * connect to it, and everything is renumbered from there. A player who cannot afford reach can walk to
 * it instead, and the same machine that was out of range at two hops is at one hop from the foothold next
 * to it. Reach is bought only with a schematic (Invariant I2); position is bought with skill.
 *
 * @param address where the machine is, and the join key everything else about it hangs off
 * @param label what to call it on screen
 * @param serverId which {@link ServerRef} it sits on
 * @param kind what it is, once a type-revealing tool has run; {@link HostKind#UNKNOWN} until then, which
 *     is the state a sweep alone leaves every machine in
 * @param tier how hard it is expected to be, on the one shared scale; {@code null} when there is none to
 *     state — the player's own rig has no difficulty, and neither has a machine whose tier recon has not
 *     established
 * @param signal how loud it is — one of the two inputs to whether a sweep finds it, the other being the
 *     instrument
 * @param hopsFromVantage distance from where the player is operating right now, not from their rig;
 *     {@code 0} for the vantage itself
 * @param vantage whether this is where the player is operating from
 * @param foothold whether the player has breached it and may {@code connect} to it
 * @param looted whether its one-time payout has already been taken — loot is a stock, not a flow
 * @param honeypotSuspected whether this looks like a trap; a suspicion, never a finding
 * @param hostsDeployedMiner whether a miner is known to be running on it
 * @param documentAvailable whether there is something here worth reading and the player has not taken it
 * @param bridgePeerServerName the <em>server</em> on the far side of a bridge; {@code ""} otherwise. Never
 *     an address, never a host count — a bridge's published function is to name the network on the other
 *     side, and anything past that is the far side's topology crossing a boundary it must not cross
