/**
 * What a mining dashboard shows: the chain, the rig's part in it, and what has actually landed.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ There is deliberately no progress figure, and that absence is the mechanic</h2>
 *
 * Mining is a <b>memoryless</b> process. Every hash is an independent trial against the same target,
 * so a rig that has been mining for three hours is exactly as close to the next block as one that
 * started a second ago — there is no partial credit, nothing accumulates, and nothing is lost by
 * stopping. A progress bar would be a lie about all four of those, and a specific and expensive one:
 * a player watching a bar fill would reasonably conclude that pulling cycles mid-bar forfeits
 * something, and would hold cycles on mining to protect progress that does not exist.
 *
 * <p>What a real mining readout shows instead is here — the <em>expected</em> time between payouts,
 * how long it has actually been, and what has landed. "Overdue" is a feeling, never a state.
 *
 * @param mode pooled or solo
 * @param cycles cycles committed to self-mining
 * @param hashrate the rig's hashrate in hashes per second
 * @param networkHashrate the whole chain's hashrate in hashes per second
 * @param difficulty network difficulty — expected hashes per block is {@code difficulty * 2^32}
 * @param shareDifficulty the difficulty this rig's pool shares are set to, or 0 when solo
 * @param height the chain's current block height
 * @param blocksUntilRetarget how many blocks until difficulty is recalculated
 * @param expectedPayoutSeconds mean seconds between payouts at this hashrate and mode
 * @param secondsSinceLastPayout how long it has actually been, or -1 if nothing has ever landed
 * @param expectedWeiPerHour the long-run rate — equal in both modes but for the pool's fee
 * @param payoutWei what one payout is worth: a whole block subsidy, or one share
 * @param lifetimePayouts blocks found, or shares accepted
 * @param lifetimeWei everything mining has ever paid this character
 * @param poolFeeBasisPoints the pool's cut, in hundredths of a percent; 0 when solo
 * @param lastPayoutAt when the last payout landed, or null
 * @param pool the pool this rig mines with, or null when solo
 * @param pendingWei earned but not yet paid out — the pool's internal balance for this rig
 * @param secondsUntilSettle how long until the pool pays up, or 0 when solo or nothing is pending
 * @param noiseCycles how loud being pooled makes this rig, in cycle-equivalents; 0 when solo
