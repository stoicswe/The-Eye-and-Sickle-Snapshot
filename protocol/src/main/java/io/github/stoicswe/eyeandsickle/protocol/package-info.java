/**
 * Wire types shared by the JavaFX client and the Spring Boot home server, plus the item-provenance
 * verifier that both sides must run identically.
 *
 * <h2>The charter</h2>
 *
 * This module is <em>not</em> a "common" junk drawer. It holds exactly three things:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Records, enums and sealed types describing what crosses the wire.
 *   <li>The provenance chain verifier, which {@code docs/architecture/04-item-provenance.md} §6.2
 *       requires to run client-side and offline so a player can confirm an item's history
 *       <em>without trusting the server's UI</em> to have checked it.
 *   <li>⚠ <strong>AT Protocol identity resolution</strong> ({@code identity}) — <em>amended
 *       2026-08-02; this charter said "exactly two things" until then.</em> The verifier in (2) has
 *       always been missing its other half: {@code provenance.SigningKeyDirectory} describes turning
 *       a {@code did:plc:xxx#key1} into a public key and resolves nothing (<b>W-1</b>). Since §6.2
 *       requires the verifier to run in the client, and {@code docs/architecture/10} §1 requires the
 *       same resolution in the server, the implementation cannot live in either module without the
 *       other copying it — and two SSRF denylists is one denylist that is wrong. It adds no
 *       dependency and holds no state. See {@code identity/package-info.java} for the full argument.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>⚠ <strong>{@code identity} is the only package here that may open a socket.</strong> Before it,
 * this module did no I/O at all, and the reasons for that austerity (a jlink candidate, shared by two
 * very different runtimes) are unchanged. {@code ArchitectureRulesTest} confines it.
 *
 * It holds no game rules. No thresholds, no prices, no yields, no compute-recovery curves, no gate
 * evaluation, no clock and no randomness. Those are authoritative state, and authoritative state
 * belongs to the server — Invariant I14: the client is never authoritative over anything a cheater
 * would forge.
 *
 * <p>{@code ArchitectureRulesTest} enforces this at build time, because a charter that is only prose
 * is a charter that erodes.
 *
 * <h2>Package layering</h2>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   game  ──►  provenance  ──►  crypto  ◄──  channel
 *                  ▲              ▲
 *                  └── identity ──┘
 * </pre>
 *
 * Dependencies point one way only, and {@code crypto} is the shared floor.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code identity} may use {@code crypto} and may be used by {@code provenance} (it is where a
 *       {@code kid} becomes a key). It must never import {@code game}: resolving who somebody is
 *       cannot be allowed to depend on what they own, or a verification failure becomes a function of
 *       game state.
 *   <li>{@code provenance} must never import {@code game}: a signed provenance payload must not be
 *       able to reference a live game value like a compute budget or a faction reputation, or the
 *       signed record stops being self-contained and independently verifiable.
 *   <li>{@code channel} — the authenticated encrypted transport ({@code
 *       docs/architecture/07-transport-security.md}) — must never import {@code game} or {@code
 *       provenance}. A transport that knows what it is carrying invites protocol logic to leak into
 *       framing, and the two have completely different threat models: the channel defends bytes in
 *       flight, provenance defends items across years and across servers.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>One consequence worth stating: {@code provenance} and {@code game} may not read a clock or an
 * RNG (their serialization must be byte-reproducible), while {@code crypto} and {@code channel}
 * must (ephemeral keys and nonces are their entire job). {@code ArchitectureRulesTest} scopes that
 * rule accordingly rather than applying one blanket ban.
