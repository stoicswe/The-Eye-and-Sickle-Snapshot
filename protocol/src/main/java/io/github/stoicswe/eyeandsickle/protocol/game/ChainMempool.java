/**
 * The mempool: everything waiting for a miner, and when each of it is expected to confirm.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ "Projected" is doing real work in that word</h2>
 *
 * A projected block is <b>not a promise</b>. It is what the next block would contain <em>if</em> it
 * were mined right now from the current pending set — which is exactly what a real explorer shows and
 * exactly as provisional. Blocks arrive on a Poisson schedule, more transactions arrive meanwhile, and
 * a miner is free to include whatever it likes. Presenting projections as a schedule would be the
 * same lie a progress bar on mining would be, one step removed.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ {@link ProjectedBlock#etaAt} is an estimate that is allowed to be overtaken (2026-07-27)</h2>
 *
 * This type used to publish <b>no</b> instant at all, on the grounds that blocks are memoryless and a
 * countdown claims that waiting brings you closer. That reasoning is still correct and it produced a
 * panel whose three cards read {@code ~14m / ~28m / ~42m} forever — a readout that never moved, which
 * players read as broken rather than as principled. The same complaint had already been filed once
 * against the block ages, for the same reason.
 *
 * <p>So an ETA is published, with the honesty moved out of the omission and into the behaviour:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>It is anchored, never accumulated.</b> {@code etaAt} is
 *       {@code lastBlockAt + (index + 1) × expectedNextBlockSeconds} — the <em>mean</em> arrival of
 *       the (index+1)-th block from the last one. Nothing is stored, nothing accrues, and the anchor
 *       jumps forward whole when a block lands. There is no hidden progress counter behind it.
 *   <li><b>It can be overtaken, and that is the normal case, not an error.</b> An exponential wait
 *       exceeds its own mean {@code 1/e ≈ 37%} of the time. A client that reached zero and said
 *       "overdue" would teach exactly the gambler's fallacy {@code ChainState} warns about, so past
 *       {@code etaAt} the honest reading is {@link ProjectedBlock#waitPercentile} — "you have waited
 *       longer than 63% of waits" — which is a true statement about the distribution and is the thing
 *       a player should be learning to read.
 *   <li><b>It never reveals the draw.</b> The solo engine really does know when its next block lands
 *       ({@code ChainState.networkWorkTarget} is drawn up front), and this deliberately is not it.
 *       Publishing the draw would make being overdue observable and would delete the lesson outright.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@link #expectedNextBlockSeconds} therefore remains the chain's <b>mean interval</b> and is not
 * a deadline; {@link #secondsSinceLastBlock} remains a fact. See
 * {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §1.3b and the 2026-07-27 entry in {@code docs/design/15}.
 *
 * @param queued everything of this rig's that is waiting, highest fee rate first, each carrying the
 *     block it currently projects into
 * @param yoursPending how many are waiting — the same count as {@code queued.size()}, kept as its own
 *     field because a remote session can report a depth it has no bodies for
 * @param projected what the next few blocks would hold if mined now, nearest first
 * @param expectedNextBlockSeconds the chain's mean block interval — an average, not a deadline
 * @param secondsSinceLastBlock how long it has actually been
 * @param lowFeeWei the cheapest fee still getting into a projected block, as an AMOUNT
 * @param highFeeWei what the top of the pending set is paying, as an AMOUNT
 *     <p>⚠ Amounts, not gas prices. These were fee-per-million-gas, which was a readable figure
 *     while an ethecoin was 100 minor units and became <b>5319047619047619000</b> the moment the
 *     scale moved to wei — a number that is not wrong so much as unusable, printed at a player who
 *     is deciding between 0.02, 0.06 and 0.30 EC.
 *     <p>The original reason for a gas price was that the clearing price and a transaction's rate
 *     were shipped in different units, so "cheapest slot 8, top of the queue 1429" read as a 180x
 *     spread when it was under 4x. Expressing BOTH as amounts fixes that comparison too, and does
 *     it in the unit the fee tiers are quoted in — which is the decision this line informs.

     *     "fees 0.00 EC" on every projection a player had nothing waiting in — which is nearly all
     *     of them. A projection is a block, and the interesting figure about a block is what mining

     *     <p>⚠ It is an <b>estimate</b> and must stay reconcilable with the block card that
     *     eventually replaces it: both are summed over the same simulated transactions at the same
     *     height, so the figure a player reads here is the figure they read again once it lands.
     *     Estimating it from the queue's depth instead would have made the two disagree by a factor
     *     of several — a projection promising 32 EC in fees followed two minutes later by a block
     *     card saying 7.60, which is the kind of contradiction {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.1
     *     trains players to read as evidence of tampering.
     *     <p>The rig's own fees are deliberately absent: a player's transaction displaces network
     *     traffic rather than adding to it, so the block's total does not move when they have
