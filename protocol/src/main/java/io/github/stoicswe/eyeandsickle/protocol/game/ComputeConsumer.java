 * What a rig's cycles are going to.
 *
 * <p>From the consumer table in {@code docs/design/01-core-resources.md} §1.1. This is a wire type
 * rather than a server-internal detail for one reason: §1.4 makes the <em>by-consumer</em> breakdown
 * a mandatory, always-visible HUD element — "the compute ledger is the game's most important HUD
 * element" — and a client cannot render a breakdown whose categories it cannot name.
 *
 * <p>The categories are here; the <em>amounts</em> never are. How many cycles a control channel
 * reserves, what a scan costs, how fast spent cycles come back — all balance values, all server-side.
 * The client is told the numbers, it does not know them.
 *
 * <p>Two consumption models coexist in this list, and the distinction is worth keeping in mind when
 * reading a {@link ComputeAllocation}: some consumers hold a <em>reservation</em> for as long as the
 * thing they power runs, others charge <em>per use</em> and then sit in {@link
 * ComputeAllocation.State#RECOVERING} while the Thermal Budget returns the cycles (§1.3).
 *
 * <p>These constants correspond to the {@code compute_allocations.consumer_type} enum proposed in
 * {@code docs/architecture/06-data-model.md} §2.
