/**
 * What the chain did while the client was closed — the report the {@code SYNCHRONIZING} screen reads.
 *
 * <h2>Why a load produces a report at all</h2>
 *
 * Until 2026-07-29 the chain froze at the last tick, so a character played on Monday and again on
 * Friday found four days of wall-clock time and zero blocks — on the one readout in the game whose
 * whole subject is that nobody owns it and nobody can stop it. The blocks are filled in now
 * ({@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §1.3d), and a height that silently jumped from 4 412 to 4 463
 * would replace one wrong impression with another: the player would have no way to tell a chain that
 * ran without them from a save that had been tampered with. So the fill is <b>shown</b>, and this is
 * what it shows.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ {@link #minedSeconds} is the invariant, stated as a number</h2>
 *
 * Invariant <b>I5</b> as amended: the rig keeps hashing for a bounded window after the client closes
 * and then stops dead. This field is how much of {@link #awaySeconds} fell inside that window, and
 * {@link #competedBlocks} is how many blocks landed in it. Everything past the cap happened with the
 * rig off — its hashrate was zero and it was drawn against nothing — which is the whole of what stops
 * a sync screen becoming a reward for closing the game.
 *
 * <p>A report where {@code competedBlocks} equalled {@code blocks} over a long absence would be that
 * invariant broken, which is why the two are carried separately rather than as one count and a flag.
 *
 * @param from when the client was last running
 * @param to the instant the chain was synchronised to — the load
 * @param awaySeconds the whole absence
 * @param minedSeconds how much of it the rig was still hashing for; never more than the cap
 * @param fromHeight the height the chain was left at
 * @param toHeight the height it was caught up to
 * @param blocks how many blocks were filled in
 * @param competedBlocks how many of them landed while the rig was still running
 * @param blocksWon solo blocks this rig won inside that window
 * @param poolBlocks blocks the rig's pool won inside it, that the rig was paid a cut of
 * @param creditedWei everything the fill actually paid — subsidy and fees together
 * @param retargets difficulty adjustments that closed during the absence
 * @param difficultyBefore difficulty at {@link #from}
 * @param difficultyAfter difficulty at {@link #to}
 * @param transactionsConfirmed the player's own pending transactions that were mined while away
 * @param truncated whether the fill hit its block limit and stopped short — see
 *     {@code Balance.CHAIN_SYNC_BLOCK_LIMIT}. Reported rather than swallowed, because a chain that
 *     quietly gave up would look identical to one that had caught up.
