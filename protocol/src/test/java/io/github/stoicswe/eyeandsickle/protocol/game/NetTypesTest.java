/**
 * The network-view vocabulary: {@link HostKind}, {@link SignalStrength}, {@link ServerRef}, {@link
 * Sighting}, {@link NetLink}, {@link NetMap}, {@link SweepReport} and {@link NetDocument}.
 *
 * <p>These eight types describe <em>what the player has found out</em> about the network, and almost every
 * interesting property of them is an absence. There is no detection roll on the wire, no ground-truth
 * defence flag, no per-server host count, and no instance at all for a machine the player has not detected
 * — each of those omissions is load-bearing, and each is the kind of thing a later contributor would add
 * back in good faith to make a renderer's life easier. So a large share of what follows tests what these
 * records refuse to carry, in the same spirit as {@link BreachResolutionTest}'s check that a resolution
 * answers what happened and never what it unlocks.
 *
 * <p>The two rules the whole vocabulary hangs off, both from the design decisions this feature was built
 * against: <strong>schematics buy reach, ethecoin buys sensitivity</strong> ({@code
 * docs/design/07-recon-tools.md} §2, Invariant I2), and <strong>an undiscovered machine leaves no
 * trace</strong>.
