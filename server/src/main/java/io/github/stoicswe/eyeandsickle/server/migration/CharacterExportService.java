/**
 * The <strong>source</strong> side of a migration: bundling a character up to leave, and the one-way
 * commit that retires it here ({@code docs/architecture/09-player-state-portability.md} §5, §6, §6.1).
 *
 * <h2>Export is read-only; the commit is separate — and that is deliberate</h2>
 *
 * Building a bundle changes nothing: the exact same read serves a backup (§5) and a migration (§6), and a
 * player may take a bundle without yet giving up their character. The no-double-play retire is a
 * <em>separate</em> step ({@link #commitMigration}), the one-way {@code active -> migrated} transition
 * that must happen before the character goes live at its new home (§6.1). Keeping them apart means a
 * failed hand-off leaves the character exactly where it was, recoverable, rather than stranded migrated —
 * and the operational full-fidelity safety net remains a PostgreSQL restore ({@code deploy/BACKUP.md}).
 *
 * <h2>Two exports, one trust line (§3)</h2>
 *
 * {@link #exportForMigration} produces the untrusted, verifiable Option-C bundle — DID and item chains
 * only, no economy, because the destination is not trusted. {@link #exportFullState} produces the trusted
 * Option-B bundle — the whole character, economy included — and is guarded so only an operator can call it
 * (the REST layer enforces {@link OperatorAuthorization} before this runs). They are different return
 * types on purpose, so a full-state bundle can never be fed to the untrusted-import path.
