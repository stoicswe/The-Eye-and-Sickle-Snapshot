/**
 * REST over the compute ledger: read the rig monitor, and allocate or release cycles.
 *
 * <h2>The client renders this; it never decides it</h2>
 *
 * Every endpoint here is a thin edge over {@link ComputeLedgerService}, which is authoritative
 * (Invariant I14). The controller's only jobs are to turn a URL and a JSON body into a service call and
 * a service result or a typed error into a status code. No rule lives here — not what a reservation
 * costs, not whether one is allowed, not how fast cycles recover. In particular, a request for more
 * cycles than exist becomes an {@link InsufficientComputeException} and a 409, never a silently
 * shrunken allocation.
 *
 * <h2>Two reads, because they answer different questions</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code GET .../compute} is the §1.4 HUD: what the owner is <em>shown</em> — total, disclosed
 *       allocations, available, recovering — with the unaccounted-for gap a hidden miner leaves.
 *   <li>{@code GET .../compute/reconciliation} is the audit surface: the authoritative arithmetic over
 *       <em>all</em> allocations, with a signed available that reads negative on an over-subscribed rig
 *       ({@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.1). It hides nothing and clamps nothing.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>What this controller does not do</h2>
 *
 * Principal-based authorization — proving the caller owns {@code rigId} — belongs to the
 * identity/security slice ({@code docs/architecture/02-identity-and-auth.md}) and is expected to sit in
 * front of this controller as a filter or method-security rule. What this slice guarantees on its own
 * is the narrower structural rule that an allocation can only be released through the rig it is charged
 * to ({@link ComputeLedgerService#release}), so even absent that filter one rig cannot touch another's
 * allocations. Opening a control channel and charging a host for a parasite are cross-rig, deployment
 * -driven operations and are intentionally not exposed as a rig-owner endpoint here.
