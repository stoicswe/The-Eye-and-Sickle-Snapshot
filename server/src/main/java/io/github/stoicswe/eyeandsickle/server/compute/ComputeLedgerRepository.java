/**
 * Hand-written SQL over {@code rigs}, {@code compute_allocations} and the {@code
 * rig_compute_reconciliation} view — the data access for the compute ledger.
 *
 * <h2>What this class does and does not decide</h2>
 *
 * It reads and writes rows; it does not decide whether an allocation is <em>allowed</em>. "May this
 * rig reserve these cycles" is a question about a sum that concurrently-inserted rows can change, so it
 * is answered in {@link ComputeLedgerService} while holding a row lock, not here. Keeping the
 * rule-free SQL in one place keeps the queries legible against the schema (the reason the project chose
 * {@code JdbcClient} over an ORM — see {@code server/pom.xml}).
 *
 * <p>Every read names its columns through the {@code *Rows} constants and never {@code SELECT *}, so a
 * migration cannot silently widen a hot query, and unit and enum columns cross the boundary through
 * {@link EconomyColumns} / {@link EnumColumns} so a mis-typed or unrecognised value fails at the read.
