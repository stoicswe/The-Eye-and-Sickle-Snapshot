/**
 * The authoritative compute ledger: rigs, and the allocation of their cycles to consumers ({@code
 * docs/design/01-core-resources.md} §1).
 *
 * <p>Everything a cheating client could lie about is decided here (Invariant I14). A request for more
 * cycles than exist is refused, not clamped; a rig's ceiling is set once at provisioning and never
 * raised by anything touching a balance (Invariant I1); a deployed miner charges its host, while the
 * deployer separately reserves a control channel on their own rig (Invariant I6).
 *
 * <h2>Concurrency: lock the rig, then decide</h2>
 *
 * "May this rig reserve these cycles" is a question about the <em>sum</em> of the rig's allocations,
 * and a concurrently-inserted row is invisible to any single row a caller has read. So every mutation
 * that depends on or changes that sum takes the rig's row lock first ({@link
 * ComputeLedgerRepository#lockRig}), in a consistent rig-id order for cross-rig work, exactly as
 * {@link io.github.stoicswe.eyeandsickle.server.persistence.Mutations} prescribes. Under that
 * discipline the reconciliation the decision reads cannot move underneath it, and no two allocations
 * can claim the same last cycle.
 *
 * <h2>Time is injected</h2>
 *
 * Recovery is time-driven ({@code docs/design/01-core-resources.md} §1.3), so the service holds a
 * {@link Clock} rather than calling {@code Instant.now()}. That is what makes "these cycles return in
 * 20 minutes" a testable assertion instead of a race against the wall.
