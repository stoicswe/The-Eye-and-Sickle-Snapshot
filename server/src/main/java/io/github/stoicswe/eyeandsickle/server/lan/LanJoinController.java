/**
 * Where a player joins a LAN server: a username in, an identity out.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ This endpoint hands an identity to anyone who asks</h2>
 *
 * That is the design ({@code docs/architecture/12-lan-mode.md} §2) and it is only defensible because
 * {@link LanAddressInterlock} guarantees the server is on a private network. It exists <strong>only in
 * LAN mode</strong> — in federated mode the bean is absent, so there is no endpoint to forget to
 * guard.
 *
 * <p>⚠ Joining does <em>not</em> create a character. It creates an identity; characters are created
 * against it afterwards, cap-checked, exactly as in federated mode
 * ({@code docs/architecture/09-player-state-portability.md} §1). Minting a character here would give
 * anyone who can reach the port an unbounded way to fill the database.
