/**
 * Reads and writes {@code players} — the identity slice's core table, now one row per <em>character</em>
 * ({@code docs/architecture/09-player-state-portability.md} §1).
 *
 * <h2>A DID is an account, not a player (09 §1, §8)</h2>
 *
 * V2 keyed one player per DID ({@code uq_players_did}); V3 drops that and moves uniqueness to
 * {@code (did, slot)}, because a DID is now an <em>account</em> that may hold up to
 * {@code CharacterProperties.maxCharacters} characters. So this repository no longer has a
 * create-or-refresh "upsert on sign-in": sign-in yields an account and its characters, and creating a
 * character is a separate, cap-checked step owned by {@link CharacterService}. The methods here are the
 * primitives that step is built from — list an account's characters, create one, look one up, and move a
 * character's lifecycle status forward.
 *
 * <h2>What this repository will not do (Invariant I1, I14)</h2>
 *
 * It never writes {@code ethecoin_balance_wei} — a balance change is a ledger transaction owned by
 * the economy, written in the same transaction as its ledger row, not a side effect here. New characters
 * are created with a zero balance and the schema's defaults, and this repository leaves it there. It also
 * does not create a {@code rigs} row: a starting rig is the compute system's concern, and this slice
 * deliberately does not reach into it.
