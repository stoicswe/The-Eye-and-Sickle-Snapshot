 * refusal — an impossible request on an authoritative server is an error, not a best effort.
 *
 * <p>It maps to {@code 409 Conflict}: the request was well-formed, but the account's current state does
 * not permit it. Note the cap is <em>soft</em> across the federation (I15): this refusal is what an
 * honest server does; a defecting server that minted a 4th character anyway would simply not be
 * recognized (09 §2).
