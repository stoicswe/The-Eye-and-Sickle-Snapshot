/**
 * Checking what an {@code UPDATE} or {@code INSERT} actually did, and the concurrency rules that go
 * with it.
 *
 * <h2>Why an update that changed nothing must never be ignored</h2>
 *
 * {@code JdbcClient.update()} returns an affected-row count and nothing forces a caller to look at
 * it. On this schema, ignoring it is how a race becomes an exploit. Two requests that both read a
 * balance of 100, both check they can afford a 60 EC purchase, and both write 40 have produced one
 * item for free. The same shape applies to seizing a miner's yield buffer twice
 * ({@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §5.1) and to two allocations claiming the same cycles.
 *
 * <h2>The house pattern: version-checked updates</h2>
 *
 * Every mutable table in the schema carries {@value #ROW_VERSION}. A mutation reads the current
 * version, then writes conditionally on it:
 *
 * {@snippet lang = java:
 * int affected = jdbcClient
 *         .sql("""
 *              UPDATE players
 *                 SET ethecoin_balance_wei = :balance,
 *                     row_version = row_version + 1
 *               WHERE player_id = :playerId
 *                 AND row_version = :expectedVersion
 *              """)
 *         .param("balance", EconomyColumns.ethecoinValue("ethecoin_balance_wei", newBalance))
 *         .param("playerId", playerId)
 *         .param("expectedVersion", expectedVersion)
 *         .update();
 * Mutations.requireUpdated(affected, "players", playerId);
 *}
 *
 * A concurrent writer bumps the version, this update matches zero rows, and {@link
 * #requireUpdated(int, String, Object)} turns that into a retryable failure instead of a lost write.
 *
 * <h2>When a version check is not enough</h2>
 *
 * Optimistic concurrency detects a conflict on a row you already read. It does not help when the
 * decision depends on rows you did <em>not</em> read — most importantly the compute ledger, where
 * "may this allocation be made" is a question about the SUM of a rig's allocations, and a
 * concurrently inserted row is invisible to any version you hold.
 *
 * <p>For those, take a row lock on the parent first, inside the transaction:
 *
 * {@snippet lang = java:
 * // Serialises every allocation decision for this rig against every other one.
 * jdbcClient.sql("SELECT rig_id FROM rigs WHERE rig_id = :rigId FOR UPDATE")
 *         .param("rigId", rigId)
 *         .query()
 *         .singleValue();
 *}
 *
 * Lock the rig, not the allocations: the rows you need to exclude are the ones that do not exist yet,
 * and only the parent row is there to lock. Take locks in a consistent order — for a cross-rig
 * operation (Invariant I6 makes those routine), order by rig id, or two players deploying onto each
 * other deadlock.
 *
 * <h2>Ledger writes are transactional, always</h2>
 *
 * A {@code ledger_transactions} row and the balance change it describes are written in ONE
 * transaction, or the ledger stops being evidence and starts being a rumour. The ledger table is
 * append-only at the database level (a trigger refuses UPDATE and DELETE), so a half-written transfer
 * cannot be tidied up afterwards — which is the point. Annotate the service method
 * {@code @Transactional}; do not rely on the auto-commit behaviour of a single {@code JdbcClient}
 * call.
