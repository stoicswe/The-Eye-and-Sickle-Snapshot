/**
 * Hand-written SQL over {@code character_directory}, the character-home directory table.
 *
 * <h2>Thin primitives; the decision lives in the service</h2>
 *
 * These methods are individual, legible statements. The multi-step convergence decision — insert vs.
 * advance vs. refresh vs. ignore-as-stale-or-conflict — is composed in {@link CharacterDirectoryService}
 * inside one {@code @Transactional} method, following the house rule that a decision spanning several
 * statements gets one transaction boundary ({@code Mutations}).
 *
 * <h2>Monotonic advance is expressed in the WHERE clause</h2>
 *
 * {@link #updateIfNewer} advances a binding only {@code WHERE sequence_number < :seq}. That single
 * predicate is the whole monotonic rule (09 §4): it is race-safe (only the highest offered sequence
 * wins, whichever connection runs first) and it can never regress a binding, which the database's
 * {@code character_directory_no_sequence_rollback} trigger then guarantees a second, independent time. A
 * wall clock never enters into it.
 *
 * <h2>Left non-{@code final} on purpose, mirroring {@code FederationPeerRepository}</h2>
 *
 * So {@link CharacterDirectoryService} can be unit-tested against an in-memory {@code
 * FakeCharacterDirectoryRepository} that overrides these methods with {@code super(null)} — the same
 * Docker-free pattern the discovery slice uses. {@code JdbcClient} surfaces a driver {@code SQLException}
 * — including the anti-rollback trigger's {@code restrict_violation} — as a Spring {@code
 * DataAccessException} on its own, so {@code @Repository}'s exception translation is not what carries it.
