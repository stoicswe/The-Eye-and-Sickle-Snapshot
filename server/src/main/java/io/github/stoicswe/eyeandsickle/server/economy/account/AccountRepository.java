/**
 * Reads and writes the money-and-heat state on {@code players}, keyed on the <strong>character</strong>.
 *
 * <h2>The character is the money holder, not the account</h2>
 *
 * A DID is now an <em>account</em> that may hold several <em>characters</em>
 * ({@code docs/architecture/09-player-state-portability.md} §1), each its own {@code players} row with its
 * own balance. The old {@code findByDid(did)} keyed on the account DID: correct while one DID meant one
 * character, but once an account holds two it matched two rows and its {@code .optional()} threw
 * ({@code IncorrectResultSizeDataAccessException}) — 09 §9's core bug. Every lookup here now resolves a
 * {@link CharacterDid} to the single {@code (did, slot)} row, so it returns exactly one character and the
 * two characters of one account keep separate balances.
 *
 * <h2>Authority, not convenience</h2>
 *
 * On an authoritative server (Invariant I14) the balance a client shows is a rumour; the balance in
 * this table is the fact. Every write here is version-checked so a concurrent one cannot be lost — two
 * requests each reading a balance of 100 and each writing 40 would hand out an item for free, and the
 * {@code row_version} guard is what turns that race into a retryable conflict ({@code
 * persistence/Mutations}).
 *
 * <h2>Reads that decide, and reads that only display</h2>
 *
 * {@link #findByCharacter(CharacterDid)} is a display/decision snapshot. {@link #lockForUpdate(Collection)}
 * is for a decision that must hold across a transfer: it takes {@code SELECT ... FOR UPDATE} on the
 * character rows, <strong>ordered by {@code player_id}</strong>, so two transfers touching the same two
 * characters in opposite directions serialise instead of deadlocking. Consistent lock order is the whole
 * reason that method takes a collection and sorts it rather than locking one row at a time.
