/**
 * The cross-slice wiring the six system slices were each building toward but none could finish.
 *
 * <p>Each slice, built in isolation, abstracted the capabilities it needed from its neighbours behind
 * a narrow interface — a DID-to-key resolver, the server's signing identity, a recognition check —
 * and shipped a safe default factory for each, expecting an integration step to register them. That
 * step is here. Every bean is {@code @ConditionalOnMissingBean}, so when a slice later contributes a
 * real implementation (a live AT Protocol DID resolver, say), it supersedes the default without a
 * change to this file.
 *
 * <h2>What is real and what is a stub, stated plainly</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Real:</strong> the server's own Ed25519 signing identity, loaded from configuration.
 *       With it the server signs and verifies its <em>own</em> items offline — the whole local
 *       provenance path works.
 *   <li><strong>Stub (safe-failure):</strong> resolution of <em>external</em> DIDs to public keys.
 *       Doing it for real means a network client that resolves {@code did:plc} via a directory and
 *       {@code did:web} over HTTPS ({@code docs/architecture/02-identity-and-auth.md} §5) — a
 *       substantial component the identity slice owns and had not reached. Until then these resolvers
 *       return {@code null}, so a signature from another server is simply <em>unverifiable</em>, which
 *       means the item is not recognized ({@code docs/architecture/04-item-provenance.md} §7). That is
 *       the correct default: refusing to recognize is safe, whereas guessing a key is not. Tracked as
 *       a wiring seam in {@code docs/design/15-open-questions.md}.
 * </ul>
