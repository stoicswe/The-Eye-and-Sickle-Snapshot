/**
 * Resolves game state and applies intent, by running <strong>the rules engine</strong>.

 * <h2>⚠ ONE engine, two places to keep its state</h2>
 *
 * This does not reimplement anything. It drives {@code GameEngine} — the same engine single player runs
 * — against state held in <em>this server's own database</em> ({@link JdbcSaveStore}). A balance
 * change in {@code design/03} therefore lands in every mode at once and cannot drift between them,
 * which is what the old "second implementation of a subset of the rules" warning in {@code CLAUDE.md}
 * was about.
 *
 * <p>⚠ <strong>Invariant I14 is satisfied, not bent.</strong> The engine runs here, on the server,
 * against server-held state. The client renders a snapshot and sends intent; it decides nothing.
 *
 * <h2>Where the ordering lives</h2>
 *
 * Load → tick → act → persist is enforced by {@link EngineSessions#inSession}, not by this class, so
 * no call site can forget it and no future intent can skip it. ⚠ That host lives in {@code solo}
 * and single player uses the same one, so the ordering cannot hold in one mode and not the other.
