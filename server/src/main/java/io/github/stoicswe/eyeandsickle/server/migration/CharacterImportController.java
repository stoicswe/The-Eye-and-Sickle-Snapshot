/**
 * REST for the <strong>destination</strong> side of an untrusted, verifiable migration (Option C,
 * {@code docs/architecture/09-player-state-portability.md} §6): the endpoint a home server exposes to
 * accept an incoming character.
 *
 * <h2>Why accepting from an untrusted caller is safe here</h2>
 *
 * The safety is not in who calls this — it is in what the service does. Every item chain is re-verified
 * with the full provenance verifier before anything is recognized, the character is minted fresh with a
 * reset economy, and the home binding only advances (§6.1). A caller cannot smuggle economy or forge an
 * item; the worst they can do is present a bundle whose items all fail verification, and they get a
 * gear-less fresh character for their trouble — one that still counts against the account's cap.
 *
 * <p><strong>Deferred:</strong> authenticating that the caller controls the bundle's account DID — the
 * immigrating account — is the same identity-filter deferral the other character endpoints carry, and the
 * cap is the only backstop until it is wired.
