/**
 * Wires LAN mode, and — more importantly — is the reason federation is <em>absent</em> rather than
 * <em>skipped</em> in it.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Absent, not flag-checked</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/architecture/12-lan-mode.md} §3: a flag consulted in fifteen places is a flag somebody
 * forgets in the sixteenth, and the sixteenth here is a quarantined item reaching the federation. So
 * the federation components are <strong>not created</strong> in a LAN-mode context: a call that should
 * not happen fails to wire, loudly, at startup, rather than failing to check, silently, in production.
 *
 * <p>The switches are on the configurations that own each subsystem
 * ({@code @ConditionalOnProperty(name = "eyeandsickle.mode", havingValue = "FEDERATED",
 * matchIfMissing = true)}), so the default — an unset or misspelled property — is the mode with the
 * security machinery on.
