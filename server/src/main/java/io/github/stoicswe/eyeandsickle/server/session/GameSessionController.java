/**
 * The game transport — two endpoints, closing the first slice of <b>CL-8</b>.
 *
 * <h2>Two endpoints, not a hundred</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/architecture/13-the-game-transport.md} §1. Reads come from one {@link GameSnapshot};
 * writes go through one {@link GameIntent}. Adding a system adds a field and a variant rather than a
 * controller, and — the part that matters — <strong>there is exactly one place a client-supplied value
 * crosses into the rules</strong>, which makes <b>I14</b> auditable instead of a property somebody
 * re-checks per controller.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The character in the path is NOT the authorisation</h2>
 *
 * A path variable is whatever the caller typed. The account is the authenticated principal, and
 * {@link GameSessionService} checks the character belongs to it before answering — otherwise this is
 * an endpoint for reading anybody's rig by guessing a UUID.
 *
 * <p>⚠ Authentication is still a seam here, exactly as it is on {@code CharacterController}, whose
 * javadoc says the DID comes "from the authenticated principal in a real deployment". See
 * {@code 13} §4 step 4, where the channel supplies it.
