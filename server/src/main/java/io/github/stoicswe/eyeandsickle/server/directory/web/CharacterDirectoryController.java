/**
 * REST over the character directory: home servers <em>publish</em> signed home records, and clients
 * <em>resolve</em> "where are my characters?" from a DID ({@code
 * docs/architecture/09-player-state-portability.md} §4).
 *
 * <h2>The client renders this; it never decides it (Invariant I14)</h2>
 *
 * Every endpoint is a thin edge over {@link CharacterDirectoryService}, which owns verification and
 * convergence. The controller's only jobs are to turn a request into a service call and a service result
 * — or a typed refusal — into a status code. No rule lives here: not signature verification, not the
 * monotonic sequence, not the soft slot cap.
 *
 * <h2>Untrusted input, bounded and typed</h2>
 *
 * A published record arrives from a server this one does not control (03 §1). It is size-capped and every
 * malformation is a typed {@link io.github.stoicswe.eyeandsickle.server.directory.CharacterHomeFault} in
 * the service, surfaced here as a {@code 422} carrying the fault name — never a stack trace and never a
 * {@code 500}. A resolution for an unknown or malformed DID returns an empty list, disclosing nothing
 * about who exists.
 *
 * <h2>Gated to federating servers</h2>
 *
 * Registered only when {@code eyeandsickle.federation.enabled=true}: the directory table lives under the
 * federation migration location, so a non-federating home server has neither the table nor a reason to
 * expose these endpoints.
 *
 * <h2>What this controller does not do — authorization</h2>
 *
 * Proving that a publish really comes from the home server it names belongs to the transport/identity
 * layer (the record's own home-server signature is the cryptographic anchor; a DID is a public,
 * gossip-safe identifier, 09 §7). As with the compute and character controllers, principal-based
 * authorization is expected to sit in front of this controller as a filter and is a documented, known
 * gap rather than a silent one.
