/**
 * How a consumer's cycles behave over time — the distinction {@code
 * docs/design/01-core-resources.md} §1.1 draws between the two consumption models that share one
 * ledger.
 *
 * <p>The compute table lists both kinds without labelling them, and the difference decides which
 * lifecycle operation is legal for a given allocation:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a {@link #RESERVATION} is held for as long as the thing it powers runs and is handed back
 *       whole the instant that thing stops — {@link ComputeLedgerService#release}. It never enters the
 *       recovering state, because nothing was <em>spent</em>; the cycles were merely occupied.
 *   <li>a {@link #PER_USE} charge is spent on a discrete action and then sits in {@link
 *       io.github.stoicswe.eyeandsickle.protocol.game.ComputeAllocation.State#RECOVERING} while the
 *       Thermal Budget returns it on a curve (§1.3) — {@link ComputeLedgerService#spend}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Getting this classification wrong is not cosmetic: letting a bot frame "recover" would hand its
 * reserved cycles back while the bot is still running, and letting a scan be "released" would skip the
 * Thermal Budget penalty that gives scanning a real opportunity cost ({@code
 * docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.2). The classification is therefore centralised here rather than
 * re-decided at each call site.
