/**
 * REST over an account's characters: list, create (cap-checked), select (open a play session), retire.
 *
 * <h2>The client renders this; it never decides it (Invariant I14)</h2>
 *
 * Every endpoint is a thin edge over {@link CharacterService}, which is authoritative. The controller's
 * only jobs are to turn a URL and body into a service call and a service result — or a typed error into a
 * status code (see {@link IdentityExceptionHandler}). No rule lives here: not the slot cap, not slot
 * assignment, not the one-way status transitions.
 *
 * <h2>What this controller does not do — account ownership</h2>
 *
 * The account is named in the path ({@code accountDid}). Proving the caller <em>is</em> that account —
 * that the bearer of the request authenticated as this DID — belongs to the identity/security filter
 * ({@code docs/architecture/02-identity-and-auth.md}) and is expected to sit in front of this controller,
 * exactly as rig-ownership authorization sits in front of the compute controller. Until that filter is
 * wired, these endpoints trust the path DID and must not face untrusted callers. That deferral is called
 * out here so it is a known gap, not a silent one. A DID is a public, gossip-safe identifier (09 §7), so
 * naming it in the path leaks nothing; the missing piece is authorization, not confidentiality.
 *
 * <h2>Select mints the play token</h2>
 *
 * Sign-in yields the account and its roster (09 §1); selecting a character is where a bearer
 * {@link PlayerSession} for <em>that</em> character is minted. One authenticated account, one selected
 * character, one session.
