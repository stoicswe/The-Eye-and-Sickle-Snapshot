/**
 * The authentication-only sign-in flow: authenticate, gate, and return the account with its characters.
 *
 * <h2>The order is the security property</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>Authenticate</strong> via {@link AtProtoIdentityProvider} — obtain a DID the caller has
 *       proven control of. A failure here never reveals anything about the allowlist.
 *   <li><strong>Gate</strong> the authenticated DID against {@link AllowlistPolicy} — closed by default
 *       ({@code docs/architecture/03-server-and-federation.md} §1). A DID that is real but not allowed is
 *       refused with {@link SignInDeniedException}.
 *   <li><strong>Load the account</strong>: the authenticated DID is an account
 *       ({@code docs/architecture/09-player-state-portability.md} §1), and its characters are read and
 *       returned so the caller can select one or create a new one. Sign-in no longer creates or refreshes
 *       a single player — that assumption is what one-character-per-DID used to encode, and it is gone.
 * </ol>
 *
 * Authenticating before gating is deliberate: the server must not disclose whether an unauthenticated DID
 * is on its allowlist, and it cannot admit an identity it has not verified. Both fall out of doing the
 * steps in this order.
 *
 * <h2>No auto-created character, no play token (09 §1-§2)</h2>
 *
 * This step is authentication and enumeration only. It does not mint a character (creation is a separate,
 * cap-checked step — {@link CharacterService#createCharacter}) and it does not open a play session (that
 * is minted per selected character — {@link CharacterService#selectCharacter}). What it returns is the
 * character-select payload: who you are, and which characters you may play.
 *
 * <h2>Authentication only (Invariant I14)</h2>
 *
 * Nothing here reads or writes the player's PDS, and nothing trusts a client-supplied value past the
 * point the provider verified it. The DID becomes a key in this server's Postgres and the source of truth
 * for the account is here — never the client, never the PDS.

     * Handles are re-claimable after release, so a cached one goes stale in a way that hands a
     * <em>different person</em> a name this server has on file for somebody else. Refreshing at
     * sign-in is the cheapest point at which that can be corrected, and it is why

     * <h2>⚠ Three states, not two</h2>

     * <ul>
     *   <li>No directory wired ({@code canVerify() == false}) — keep what the provider said. This is
     *       what the server ships as today, and the handle is unverified; the fix is to wire a
     *       resolver, not to pretend here.
     *   <li>Verified — use it.
     *   <li>Checked and nothing verified — <strong>drop the handle entirely</strong>. Falling back to
     *       the provider's unverified handle here would make the whole check decorative: an attacker
     *       whose DID document claims {@code at://a-rivals.handle} would simply fail verification and
     *       be displayed as the rival anyway. {@code AccountSession} tolerates a null handle, and the
     *       DID is always there.
