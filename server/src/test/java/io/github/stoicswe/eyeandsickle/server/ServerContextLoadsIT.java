/**
 * The single most important test of "does the server actually run": it boots the whole Spring
 * context against a real, Flyway-migrated PostgreSQL and asserts that every bean wires.
 *
 * <p>Compilation proves the code is type-correct; it says nothing about whether the six slices'
 * beans satisfy each other's dependencies. Each slice defined its own seams (a DID key resolver, a
 * signing identity, a peer transport) and none could see the others, so an unsatisfied injection
 * point is exactly the failure mode a context-load test exists to catch — and the only one that
 * turns "compiles" into "starts".
 *
 * <p>Runs under {@code mvn -Pit verify} (needs Docker), so the default Docker-free build stays green.
 * The datasource is wired via {@link DynamicPropertySource} rather than {@code @ServiceConnection} so
 * no extra Boot-testcontainers dependency is required.

     * the test suite: these were Testcontainers tests that could only run where a Docker daemon was
