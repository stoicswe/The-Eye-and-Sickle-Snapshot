# 07 — Recon & Discovery Tools

**Status:** Established (design sessions 1–5)
**Depends on:** `02-unlock-gates.md`, `01-core-resources.md` §3 (noise)
**Depended on by:** `04-mining.md` (Provenance Tracer), `05-hacking-minigame.md` (information before the breach)

Information tools. Recon is how a player converts session time and compute into *knowing* before *doing* — which is what makes conditional tools like Rainbow Table (`06`) worth owning and what keeps breaches from being blind gambles.

---

## 1. Tool table (established)

| Tool | Function | Gate | Cost | Compute | Noise |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Passive Sniffer** | Reveals adjacent node types without touching them | Ethecoin | 15 EC | 3 | None |
| **Topology Mapper** | Extends graph visibility from one hop to two | **Schematic** | — | 9 | None |
| **Traffic Analyzer** | Distinguishes active/defended nodes from dormant ones | Reputation | — | 6 | Low |
| **Ping Sweep** | Locates offline players' exposed stashes | Ethecoin | 45 EC | 8 | **High — target is notified something pinged them** |
| **Honeypot Detector** | Flags Eye-planted traps | Schematic | — | 11 | Low |
| **Provenance Tracer** | Audits the player's own deployed miners for hijacking or channel sabotage | Ethecoin | 30 EC | 4 | None |

## 2. Per-tool notes

**Passive Sniffer** — cheap, silent, adjacency-only. The default "look before you leap." Its limits (one hop, types only) are what make Topology Mapper and Traffic Analyzer worth graduating to.

> ⚠ **NOT BUILT, and its product is no longer the whole of typing a machine (2026-08-09).** There is no `passive-sniffer` in `Catalogue` and no port-scan rung that sells a type, so until this date **nothing in the shipped game could establish a machine's kind at all** — every box on the network map read `----` forever while nine code comments deferred to this row. Two acts now type a machine: a **DEEP sweep** types what it picks up, and a **foothold** types it outright (standing on a machine, what it is cannot be avoided — the same argument that already gave a breach the machine's name and its operator account). **BASE and WIDE sweeps still sell existence and adjacency and nothing else**, which is what this tool would still sell when it ships: typing a machine found cheaply and not broken into, without paying a DEEP sweep's cycles or breaking in. Logged in `15` §3; `IdentificationTest` holds both halves.
>
> ⚠ **It no longer names the server behind a bridge.** That was this tool's one bridge-specific product and it moved to the two acts that genuinely look across a crossing — a **DEEP survey** from the bridge, or a **NET_MAN** running on it (`18` §2.7a–2.8) — which is the same condition that puts the far server's tab on the map. A foothold types a bridge *as* a bridge and tells the player nothing about where it goes.

**Topology Mapper** — a **ceiling** on information (1 hop → 2 hops), hence schematic-gated not purchasable (Invariant I2). Two-hop vision fundamentally changes Traversal-class planning (`05`), which is why it's a found capability rather than a shop item.

**Traffic Analyzer** — separates live/defended targets from dormant ones. Reputation-gated because knowing which nodes are *worth* hitting (and which will fight back) is economy-distorting if free. Directly supports proof-of-skill (you must hit *live/defended* targets for credit, `02` §2.4) — this tool tells you which those are.

**Ping Sweep** — the offline-raid enabler: finds other players' exposed High-Hackable stashes (`01` §6). The **high noise + target notification** is the deliberate balance: raiding is not stealthy reconnaissance, the victim knows *someone is casing them*. This is a PvP instigation tool and should feel like one.

**Honeypot Detector** — flags Eye traps, but **must have a false-negative rate** (established): a perfect detector removes the fear the traps exist to create. Target **75–85% detection** — high enough to be worth the schematic and compute, low enough that you can never fully trust a "clear" reading.

> **[PROPOSAL]** Pin the false-negative behavior: on a scanned trap, ~80% chance it's flagged, ~20% it reads clean. A *clean* reading is therefore never a guarantee; a *flagged* reading is always true (no false positives — a false alarm would train players to ignore it). One-directional error preserves tension without breaking trust in positive results.

**Provenance Tracer** — audits the player's *own* deployed miners for hijacking (Cuckoo Patch victimization) or channel sabotage (`04-mining.md` §5). Unglamorous and essential: it is the **only** counter to being hijacked, and running it costs session time that would otherwise earn — the exact tension that stops large deployment networks from being free money (`03-economy.md` §1.1). Zero noise (you're auditing your own assets), low compute, EC-gated as a replaceable operational tool.

## 3. The recon → action pipeline

The intended play pattern the tool set encodes:

1. **Passive Sniffer / Topology Mapper** → learn the graph shape.
2. **Traffic Analyzer** → learn which nodes are live, defended, worth it.
3. **Honeypot Detector** → learn which are traps (with residual doubt).
4. Commit to a breach (`05`) with the right loadout (`06`), or walk away.
5. Post-op / periodically: **Provenance Tracer** to keep the deployed network honest.

Every step is optional and every step costs compute and/or time — the skill is knowing when the information is worth more than the cycles. A reckless player skips recon and eats honeypots and defended nodes; a paranoid player over-scans and out-costs their own income. The sweet spot is the game.

## 4. Balance note

Recon has **no offensive power** — it never breaches, never takes. Its entire value is reducing variance on the *next* action. That's why most recon is silent (None/Low noise): information-gathering shouldn't itself be the risky part, except where it's inherently intrusive (Ping Sweep pings a live target; that one's loud on purpose).

## 5. The network sweep ladder — [PROPOSAL]

The sweep is the verb that fills the map. It is not in §1's table because it is not one of the six named tools: it is the *baseline* discovery action every one of those tools is bought to refine, and it has three sensitivities rather than being a single purchase.

| Tier | Item id | Gate | Cost | Compute | Duration | Noise |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Base sweep** | `net-sweep` | **Starting kit** | — | 2 | ~20 s | **High (35)** |
| **Wide sweep** | `net-sweep-wide` | Ethecoin | 25 EC | 5 | ~45 s | **High (55)** |
| **Deep sweep** | `net-sweep-deep` | Ethecoin | 55 EC | 9 | ~90 s | **Very high (80)** |

### 5.1 Running a sweep never costs ethecoin

The **tool** is bought once; **running** it spends cycles and exposure and nothing else. This is not a concession, it is forced by two things at once. Ethecoin never buys a ceiling (**I2**), and discovery is upstream of every ethecoin faucet in the game — a per-run charge would mean a player short of money could not find the machines that are how money is earned, which is a spiral with no floor. The base tier is starting kit for the same reason Port Sweep is (`06` §2): without it a new player cannot find what is next to them, and the whole network half of the game is unreachable.

What the two purchasable tiers buy is **sensitivity within reach the player already has** — how quiet a machine can be and still be heard. Reach itself is the Topology Mapper's, schematic-gated, and no amount of ethecoin moves it (§2).

### 5.1a What a sweep can hear depends on where it is standing — [PROPOSAL], 2026-08-08

**A machine is not equally audible from every position on the network.** The value a sweep's threshold
is compared against used to be the machine's own roll and nothing else, so a contact a base sweep
missed from the rig was missed from *every* position at that tier: moving the vantage brought
different machines inside the hop ceiling and never made an in-range machine findable. Repositioning
bought reach and only reach.

It is now a property of the **pair**:

```
audibility(machine, vantage) = detectRoll × (FLOOR + (1 − FLOOR) × hash(machine, vantage))
```

with `Balance.NET_SWEEP_VANTAGE_FLOOR` at **0.55**. So two footholds the same distance from a machine
are two genuine chances at it, and a player who breaches outward keeps growing their graph rather than
widening one circle. Measured over 300 worlds and 12 positions: staying home finds **5.1** machines
however many times you sweep; walking finds **10.1** at base tier and **19.8** at wide.

⚠ **Four properties this is built around, none of them optional.**

1. **Re-sweeping is still not a re-roll.** The vantage term is **hashed, never drawn**, so the same
   spot answers the same way forever and save-scumming still buys nothing. This is the whole reason
   it is a hash and not a die — implemented as a per-sweep draw it would look like the same feature
   and would make repetition the cheapest discovery strategy in the game.
2. **The home floor survives exactly.** `TopologyGenerator` forces three home neighbours to
   `detectRoll = 0`, and the perturbation is a **multiply**, so zero stays zero from everywhere. An
   additive spread would have lifted those three off the floor on some seeds only — the worst
   available way for a new player's first sweep to break.
3. **A better instrument never loses a contact.** The factor does not depend on the tier, so
   `detected(T1) ⊆ detected(T2) ⊆ detected(T3)` is unchanged; and since the factor is at most 1,
   nothing findable under the old rule became unfindable.
4. **`FLOOR` is what keeps the ladder worth buying.** At 0 the multiply roughly doubles detection and
   the base/deep gap collapses; at 0.55 a quiet machine goes 35% → ~47% at base and 72% → ~89% at
   deep, so the T1→T3 ratio is essentially unchanged — and past about `detectRoll 0.64` a machine is
   inaudible at base tier from **every** position in the world, which is what leaves something for
   the instrument to sell. `VantageDiscoveryTest` measures all four rather than asserting them.

⚠ **Per player by construction, and that is free rather than designed.** A world is generated from the
character id, so two players never share a topology — and even on one world the graph each builds
depends on which positions they occupied, in what order, at which tier. Nothing here has to agree
across a server.

⚠ **The yield band is 1–11**, widened from 1–7 on the same day: `Balance.sweepYield`, 7–11 at home
falling to 1–5 four servers out. Raising home's floor is nearly free — the home server seeds five
machines at one link, so the cap does not bind there and detection is what limits a first sweep. The
widening pays at depth 1–3, on the larger servers a player reaches by moving.

⚠ **The bridge tier gate is what actually bounds a base-only player**, not any of the above.
`NET_SWEEP_BRIDGE_MIN_TIER = 2` means a base sweep cannot see a `BRIDGE` at any distance, so a player
who has not bought the wide sweep can walk their home server and no further: measured, their graph
plateaus around ten machines however long they keep moving, where a wide-sweep player reaches 35 by
twenty-five positions. That is §5.1's "what the two purchasable tiers buy" working as designed — but
it is the number to re-read before anyone re-tunes that constant in either direction.

### 5.1b A machine that has more to give says so — the link estimate — [PROPOSAL], 2026-08-09

On explicit direction. A discovered machine carries a **rough count of how many machines are attached
to it**, drawn on the map as a small tag inside its cell — `TERM [#] 5?` — and **published only while
at least one of those connections is still unfound**. `Sighting.linkEstimate`,
`Balance.netLinkEstimate`, `NET_LINK_ESTIMATE_ACCURACY_PERCENT` (70, i.e. ±30%).

**The problem it solves.** §5.1 sells WIDE and DEEP as *sensitivity, not reach* — they hear quieter
machines from the same position. That is a good design and an invisible one: from the player's side a
re-sweep that finds nothing is indistinguishable from a re-sweep that could never have found
anything, so the two ethecoin upgrades were a purchase made blind and re-sweeping felt like
button-mashing. The tag makes the ladder legible. It answers **"is another sweep from here worth its
cycles?"** and refuses to answer **"what would it find?"**.

⚠ **THE ABSENCE IS THE INFORMATION.** A machine wearing a tag has something left; a machine that has
stopped wearing one has given up everything it has and the lines on screen are the whole story. So
the suppression is computed in the rules from the truth, never by a renderer comparing the estimate
against the edges it drew — the estimate is a *band* and can sit either side of the real number, so a
renderer doing that arithmetic would hold the tag up forever on some machines and drop it early on
others.

⚠ **THIS IS THE ONLY THING THE MAP PUBLISHES ABOUT MACHINES THE PLAYER HAS NOT FOUND**, and it needs
its licence stated because the standing rule is the opposite: an undiscovered host does not exist,
and `18` §2.7c refuses to publish a server's completion metric on exactly those grounds. The licence
is the one `SweepReport.inRange` already stands on — **it is the instrument's own sensitivity**. It
carries no address, no type, no tier and no value. A sweep may say it heard something it could not
resolve; it may not say what. Four properties keep it there, and all four are asserted:

1. **Suppressed** to nothing once every connection is found.
2. **Deliberately wrong**, by up to 30%, and **hashed from the address** rather than drawn — asking
   twice gives the same answer forever, because re-sweeping is not a reroll and an estimate that
   moved when asked would let a player average it down to the exact count.
3. **Cross-server links are excluded from both sides.** What is behind a bridge is `18` §2.7a's
   question, bought dearly with a DEEP survey from a foothold on it. Counting the crossing here would
   answer it for free and give two figures for one question — so a bridge whose only unfound
   neighbour is across the water correctly reports nothing at all.
4. **Never below the count already drawn.** A machine showing four links beside a tag reading "about
   3" reads as a broken instrument rather than as a band. Since the figure is only published when a
   real link is missing, flooring it above what is visible is a correction *toward* the truth.

⚠ **The accuracy is tighter than the bridge survey's (70 vs 60) and the two constants must not be
merged.** That one bands a server's population, which runs to twenty-odd; this one bands a link
count, which runs 1–7 — and ±40% of 2 is "between 1 and 3", which is noise wearing a number. At ±30%
a five-link machine reads as 4–7: enough to decide, nowhere near enough to skip the sweep.

⚠ **The `?` is the accuracy, in the one character the cell can spare.** Every other estimate in the
game travels beside an explicit accuracy figure precisely so no surface can render it as a count
(`NodeState.peerEstimate`). There is no room for one in an 18-column cell, so the mark carries "this
is not exact" and the **tooltip and screen-reader line carry it in words** — and they state the
consequence rather than the number, because "another sweep from here may still turn something up" is
the decision the figure exists to inform.

⚠ **Open — where the tag is drawn.** The sketch it was asked from hangs it in the corridor beside the
machine, which reads better. The corridor belongs to the map's *gap* label, styled `-es-rule-hi` —
one of the three tokens `ContrastTest` exempts from its 3:1 floor *because* they draw hairlines — so
putting a number a player must read there would repeat the defect this map already shipped once, when
CONTACT and LOCKED were drawn in the greeble token at 1.77:1. It rides the cell's interior line
instead, in four columns that line has always padded, which is width-neutral by construction. Moving
it into the corridor needs the tag to become its own node overlaid on the gap and wants its own pass.

### 5.2 A sweep is cheap and loud, and those are two different numbers

The compute column and the noise column are **not derived from each other**, and the split is deliberate.

- **Compute** is how much of the player's own rig the job occupies. A sweep occupies almost none of it.
- **Noise** is how much racket reaches machines that are not the player's. A sweep is nothing but that — it puts packets on hosts it has no business touching, which is precisely what `08` §1 means by "noise is generated by **acting**".

Deriving one from the other was the first implementation and it was wrong on screen: noise renders as outward cycles over rig capacity, so a two-cycle sweep moved a 100-cycle rig's meter by two percent — indistinguishable from silence — and got *quieter* as the player's rig grew, which inverts what the instrument is for. Ping Sweep is the precedent the table already had: **High** noise for a tool whose compute cost is 8.

### 5.3 Loud while it runs, silent the moment it ends

A sweep contributes its full noise for its whole duration and **exactly nothing afterwards**. There is no decay curve and no trailing figure: the moment the countdown reaches zero the meter drops back to whatever the rig was already doing.

That is the general rule rather than a property of sweeps. **Noise is a rate, not a debt.** What a loud act leaves behind is **heat** (`01` §4), which is persisted, decays on its own schedule, and is what the Eye actually acts on. Collapsing the two would give the player a number that never came down and no way to read the difference between *"I am being loud"* and *"I have been loud"* — and the stealth kit in `08` answers those two with different tools at different prices.

### 5.4 Filing what has been found — [PROPOSAL]

A discovered machine can be filed into a **folder**, and folders nest (5 levels). This is a bookmark and nothing more:

- It costs no compute, no ethecoin and no time, there is no limit on how many folders exist, and nothing in the game is gated on having them. There is therefore no gate to classify under `02` §1.1 — a quantity a gate could attach to is exactly what this does not have.
- Filing a machine changes **nothing mechanical**: not its tier, not its defences, not what a sweep costs, not what a breach faces.
- ⚠ **Only a discovered address can be filed, and the refusal for an undiscovered address is word-for-word the refusal for one that does not exist.** Two distinguishable refusals would let a player enumerate the world one guess at a time, for free — which is the entire product this ladder is sold on.

The model is a filesystem, not a tag set: one parent per folder, one folder per machine, and the verbs are `mkdir`, `rmdir` and `mvdir`. Moving a *machine* is `file`, deliberately not `mv` — real `mv(1)` moves anything, and a verb here that meant only "reparent a folder" would teach something false about the command it borrowed its name from. Removing a folder is **never recursive**: its contents move up one level. Filing carries no risk lesson, so there is nothing to be gained by making a mis-click expensive.
