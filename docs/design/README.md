# Design Documentation — The Eye and Sickle

This folder is the **design source of truth** for the game's systems, economy, and world. The companion folder `../architecture/` covers the *technical* stack (client, servers, identity, federation). Read `../../CLAUDE.md` at the repo root first for the invariants and conventions.

## Reading order

New to the project: read **`00` → `01` → `02` → `03`** in order. That's the spine — vision, resources, gates, economy. Everything else hangs off those four.

The **client's** visual design and UI — how all of this is presented to the player — lives in [`../client/`](../client/README.md).

The **curriculum** — the real computing knowledge the game teaches, and the record of whether each
claim is actually true — lives in [`../education/`](../education/README.md). It depends on this folder
(`glossary.md` fixes the canonical names) and on `../client/04-terminology-and-education.md` (which
fixes how a definition reaches the player); it never re-decides either.

## Status tags — what they mean

- **Established** — decided in design sessions 1–5 (captured in the project's `ethecoin_design_doc.md`) or in the two technology chats. Change these only deliberately; they're what the rest depends on.
- **[PROPOSAL]** — first-pass design written to fill a gap the source material left open (chiefly the core minigame, player-facing multiplayer, and the world/narrative). Clearly marked at the top of each doc and inline. Keep, edit, or replace freely — nothing else is built to depend on the *specifics* of a proposal, only on established rules.

The split matters: a proposal can be wrong without breaking anything; an established invariant can't be touched without a redesign. When you resolve a proposal into a decision, update the doc, drop the [PROPOSAL] tag, and log it in `15` §3.

## The invariants

`00` §4 lists 15 hard invariants (I1–I15) — the load-bearing rules. `../../CLAUDE.md` mirrors them. If a change would violate one, the change is almost certainly wrong. They exist because each one, if broken, collapses a specific system (usually the compute economy or the risk economy).

## Provenance of this documentation

Extracted and expanded from:
- `ethecoin_design_doc.md` (the project's consolidated design doc, sessions 1–5) — all economy/systems content.
- **Tech Chat 1** — the full technology stack decision (→ `../architecture/`).
- **Tech Chat 2** — provenance schema, validator sampling, reputation math (→ `../architecture/04`, `05`).

Gaps the sources left open were filled with clearly-tagged proposals rather than left blank, so Claude Code sessions have something concrete to build against.
