/**
 * Flashing firmware: a minute and a half with the tool down.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a task rather than an instant install</h2>
 *
 * Every other install in the game is instantaneous, because the interesting wait — somebody else's
 * uplink — already happened during the download. Firmware is the deliberate exception: the affected
 * tool is frozen for the duration, so the cost is real income foregone rather than a bar to watch.
 * Being a {@code TaskState} is what makes it survive a quit, which a device writing its own memory
 * must.
