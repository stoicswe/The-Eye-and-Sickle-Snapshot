/**
 * The mining simulation, checked against the distribution it claims to be.
 *
 * <h2>Why these are statistical tests and have to be</h2>
 *
 * Every interesting property here is a property of a <em>distribution</em>: that the two modes pay
 * the same in expectation, that one of them is enormously lumpier, that the wait is exponential
 * rather than merely random. None of those can be asserted from one sample, and a golden-value test
 * over a fixed seed would pass while the model was wrong in every way that matters — it would only
 * be checking that the arithmetic is deterministic, which it trivially is.
 *
 * <p>So these simulate long runs against a seeded {@link Rng} and assert on the aggregate. They are
 * deterministic (same seed, same answer, so no flakes) while still measuring the thing.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The tolerances are honest, not generous</h2>
 *
 * A solo run of a few hundred blocks has a standard error of {@code 1/sqrt(n)} — about 5% at 400
 * blocks — so a 3% tolerance on solo income would be a test that fails on luck. The bands below are
 * sized from that arithmetic rather than tightened until they passed, which is the failure mode a
 * statistical test invites.

     * that had only done one of them — and the one it would miss is PPS, which is what the default
     * pool and every new character use.
     *
     * <h2>⚠ These are the tests that would have caught the literal implementation</h2>
     *
     * Halving the chosen pool's {@code networkShare()} in the winner draw is the obvious way to write
