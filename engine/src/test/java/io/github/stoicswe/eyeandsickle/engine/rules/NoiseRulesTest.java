/**
 * Tests for how loud the rig is.
 *
 * <p>Two things are being defended and both are load-bearing. The first is that <b>a busy rig is not
 * a loud rig</b> — Invariants I4 and I9 and {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.1 each make one kind
 * of work silent, and together they are the quiet-play strategy the economy is built to reward. The
 * second is that <b>loudness is present-tense</b>: a sweep is one of the loudest acts in the game and
 * contributes exactly nothing the moment it ends.
