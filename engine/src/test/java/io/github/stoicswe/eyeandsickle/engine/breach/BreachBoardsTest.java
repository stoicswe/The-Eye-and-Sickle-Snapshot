/**
 * Board generation, and the one property that matters more than any of it: a board is solvable and a
 * snapshot never carries the answer.
 *
 * <p>The generation tests are property tests over many seeds rather than golden-value tests over one.
 * A board is a random object with rules, and the rules are what a player learns — a test pinned to a
 * single seed would pass while every other board in the game was wrong.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The two classes are tested for opposite things, on purpose</h2>
 *
 * {@code BREACH_PROTOCOL} publishes everything and hides nothing, so what has to be proved about it
 * is that a path <em>exists</em> — an open-information puzzle whose goal is unreachable is not hard,
 * it is broken, and nothing on screen would tell the player which. {@code OFFSET_CIPHER} publishes
 * two rows and hides the arithmetic between them, so what has to be proved about it is that the
 * arithmetic has exactly one answer and that no surface leaks it.
