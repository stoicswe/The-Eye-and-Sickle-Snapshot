/**
 * A character created before the world generator existed can reach the network.
 *
 * <h2>The bug this is the regression test for</h2>
 *
 * {@code GameSave.topology} is null on a save written before it was added, and the field was
 * documented as deliberately left that way so an old character would "keep working with an empty map
 * rather than being handed a freshly rolled world on load". The reasoning is right about
 * regeneration and wrong about the outcome, because a null topology is not a small world — it is
 * <em>no</em> world:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code NetRules.view} returns an empty map, so the graph, the list and {@code net} all show
 *       nothing, forever.
 *   <li>{@code NetRules.beginSweep} returns empty at every tier, so no sweep can ever run.
 *   <li>The refusal that reached the player said <em>"not enough available compute"</em> — naming a
 *       resource they had ninety cycles of, and sending them to fix something that was not broken.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>It reproduced on a real save. The three assertions below are, in order: the world arrives, the
 * sweep works, and nothing was rerolled.
