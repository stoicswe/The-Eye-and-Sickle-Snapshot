     *
     * <h2>Why this was invisible for two days</h2>
     *
     * {@code NpcNames.server} hashes an id, and hashing reads as "and therefore it varies". The id is
     * {@code HostArchetypes.serverId(index)} — the string {@code "srv-0"} — so it varies across the
     * <em>servers of one world</em> and not at all across worlds. Every character generated between
     * 2026-08-08 and 2026-08-10 called its home server {@code candid-noctilus}; the fixed list of
     * seven that the pool replaced had become a fixed list of seven different names, which every test
     * in {@link Servers} above passes happily because every one of them is about one world.
     *
     * <p>Machines had it worse: an address is {@code 10.<server>.<page>.<2 + index>}, so the name at
     * a position was the same in every world — and host index 0 is always the gateway, which makes a
     * fixed mapping a reliable tell for what a machine <em>is</em>. That is the leak the pool
     * replaced {@code <server>-<NN>} to close, arriving back through the front door.
     *
     * <p>⚠ Both assertions were run against the unsalted code first, where they fail on the first
     * comparison — a test of "two worlds differ" written after the fix is one that would pass just as
     * well against a build that made them differ for some unrelated reason.
