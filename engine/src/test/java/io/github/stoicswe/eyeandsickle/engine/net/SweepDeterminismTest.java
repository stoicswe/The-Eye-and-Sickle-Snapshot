/**
 * Why running the same sweep twice is a waste of two cycles.
 *
 * <h2>Save-scumming is defeated by construction, not by a cooldown</h2>
 *
 * {@link HostState#detectRoll} is drawn once, at world generation, and stored. A sweep makes
 * <em>no</em> detection draw — it compares a threshold set by the sweep tier, the host's signal and
 * the hop distance against that fixed number, scaled by a <b>hash</b> of the host and the vantage. So
 * the same tier from the same vantage returns a bit-identical candidate set, every time, forever.
 * Quitting without saving changes nothing, because every input predates the sweep.
 *
 * <p>⚠ <b>The vantage term arrived on 2026-08-08 and it is a hash, not a die — which is the only
 * reason this file still passes.</b> "What you can hear depends on where you are standing" is a
 * feature that reads exactly like a per-sweep roll, and implemented as one it would have made
 * re-sweeping a lottery and save-scumming profitable again. {@code VantageDiscoveryTest} owns the new
 * behaviour; this file owns the thing it was not allowed to cost.
 *
 * <p>Only two things move the outcome, and both cost: a <b>higher sweep tier</b> (ethecoin, plus its
 * own compute, duration and noise) or a <b>different vantage</b> (a breach, a foothold and a
 * {@code connect}). This file is the proof of each.
 *
 * <h2>Monotonicity is the other half</h2>
 *
 * A player who buys a better instrument must never lose a contact they already had. That makes
 * {@code detected(T1) ⊆ detected(T2) ⊆ detected(T3)} a required property rather than a pleasant one —
 * an upgrade that could hide a machine you had already seen would make the purchase illegible, and
 * illegible purchases are how a player learns to stop buying things.
