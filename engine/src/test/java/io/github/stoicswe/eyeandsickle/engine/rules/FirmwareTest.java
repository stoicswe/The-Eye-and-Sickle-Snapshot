/**
 * Firmware upgrades: two things to hold, one thing to stop.
 *
 * <h2>What firmware is, in this game and in the world</h2>
 *
 * Firmware sits <em>below</em> the program it upgrades, and every rule here is that fact rather than a
 * game-ism. You cannot rewrite a device's firmware while the device is using it, so the install
 * refuses. The schematic is the authorisation and the image is the payload, so neither alone does
 * anything. And it costs more, because it is a permanent capability's payload rather than a
 * consumable.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The invariant this must not break</h2>
 *
 * The image is purchasable and the capability is not. {@code docs/design/02-unlock-gates.md} §1.1
 * sanctions exactly this split — <em>"Rainbow Table is EC + schematic (buy the table, but the
 * capability to use it is found)"</em> — under the standing condition that <b>the ceiling component is
 * on the non-EC side</b>. {@link Gating} is the guard: money must never produce the schematic, and the
 * image alone must never install.
