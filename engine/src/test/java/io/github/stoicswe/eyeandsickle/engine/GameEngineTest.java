         * <h2>⚠ This test used to assert ZERO, and the change is a design decision, not a fix</h2>
         *
         * I5 read "self-mining runs online-only" and this asserted a week away paid nothing. It was
         * amended on 2026-07-29 ({@code docs/design/15-open-questions.md} §3): the rig keeps hashing
         * for {@code Balance.OFFLINE_MINING_HOURS} after the client closes and then stops dead.
         *
         * <p>What the old rule actually protected against was <b>absence out-earning play</b> on an
         * income stream that is also zero-heat and unseizable (I4) — and a cap defeats that on its
         * own. So the assertion that matters is no longer "nothing" but <b>"a month away pays what
         * four hours pays"</b>: the moment income tracks the absence, it is farmable and the
         * invariant is gone.
         *
         * <h2>⚠ Asserted structurally first, and only then on the money</h2>
         *
         * The two structural figures — how long the rig was credited as hashing, and how many blocks
         * it was in the draw for — are <b>exact</b> and are what the cap actually does. The balances
         * are then compared as a band rather than for equality, because they legitimately differ: a
         * longer fill walks more blocks, each block consumes RNG draws, and the pay-per-share clock
         * downstream therefore lands on different share targets. That is realised variance on an
         * unchanged expectation, and it is the same variance an online session has. Asserting exact
         * equality there would be asserting that the generator is not being used.
