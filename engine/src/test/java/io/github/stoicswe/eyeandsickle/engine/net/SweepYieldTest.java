/**
 * How much one sweep hands over — 5–7 at home, falling to 1–3 past a couple of bridges.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ THE CAP IS ABSOLUTE PER (VANTAGE, TIER), NEVER PER ATTEMPT</h2>
 *
 * {@code NetRules}' spine is that "only two things move the outcome and both cost: a higher sweep
 * tier, or a closer vantage". A cap that reset each sweep would have made repetition the cheapest of
 * the three and turned discovery into button-mashing. Sweeping the same spot twice still reports
 * nothing new; the rest of a server is reached by <em>moving</em>.
