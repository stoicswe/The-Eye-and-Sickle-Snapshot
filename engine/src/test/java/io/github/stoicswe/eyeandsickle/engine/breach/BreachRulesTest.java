/**
 * Tests for the breach engine.
 *
 * <p>These concentrate on the properties a player would actually notice going wrong, and on the
 * invariants a breach is capable of violating: I9 (a crack is heat-free on every outcome), I1/I2
 * (breach loot never mints ethecoin), I7/I13 (tier-gated, never count-gated), I10 (the human read
 * beats a fixed heuristic), and the two correctness properties nothing else can catch — that the
 * RNG is committed, and that a snapshot never carries the answer.
