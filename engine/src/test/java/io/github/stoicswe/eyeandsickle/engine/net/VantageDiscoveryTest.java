/**
 * Why moving is worth a breach: what a sweep hears depends on where it is standing.
 *
 * <h2>The change this file exists for</h2>
 *
 * Detection used to compare a threshold against {@link HostState#detectRoll} alone — a property of
 * the <b>machine</b>. So a contact a base sweep missed from the rig was missed from <em>every</em>
 * position at that tier, and repositioning bought nothing but a different set of neighbours inside
 * the hop ceiling. It now compares against {@code detectRoll × (FLOOR + (1 − FLOOR) × hash(machine,
 * vantage))} — a property of the <b>pair</b> — so two positions are two chances at the same machine,
 * and a player working outward keeps growing their graph.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ WHAT MUST NOT HAVE MOVED, and why each is here rather than assumed</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Re-sweeping is still not a reroll.</b> The vantage term is <b>hashed, not drawn</b>, so
 *       the same spot answers the same way forever. {@code SweepDeterminismTest} owns the sweep-level
 *       proof; what is asserted here is the one line underneath it.
 *   <li><b>The home floor survives.</b> Three home neighbours are forced to {@code detectRoll = 0},
 *       and the perturbation is a multiply, so they stay audible from everywhere. An additive spread
 *       would have lifted them off the floor — this is the assertion that would have caught it.
 *   <li><b>The sensitivity ladder survives.</b> If a new position could find anything, nobody would
 *       buy a louder instrument. Measured here rather than argued.
 * </ul>
