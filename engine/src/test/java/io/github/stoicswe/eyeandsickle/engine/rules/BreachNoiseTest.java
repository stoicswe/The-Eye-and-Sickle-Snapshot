/**
 * A breach is heard, and it is heard less than a sweep.
 *
 * <h2>The ordering is the balance statement</h2>
 *
 * A sweep touches every machine within reach and announces itself to all of them; a breach is one
 * connection to one machine. <b>The cheapest sweep must be louder than the worst breach</b>, or the
 * sweep ladder's price — two cycles for the loudest act in the game — stops making sense. That is
 * asserted here rather than left to whoever next re-tunes either number.
