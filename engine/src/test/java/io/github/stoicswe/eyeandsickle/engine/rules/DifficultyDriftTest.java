/**
 * Difficulty must have no <em>trend</em>.
 *
 * <p>{@code ChainState} is explicit that this chain's network hashrate never changes, so every
 * retarget's adjustment should land near 1.0 and difficulty should sit at
 * {@code Balance.chainDifficultyFor} give or take the couple of percent that 1440 random block times
 * are worth. It is also strongly mean-reverting by construction: the adjustment is
 * {@code expected / actual}, and {@code actual} is itself proportional to the current difficulty, so
 * one retarget pulls a displaced difficulty most of the way home. A drift that survives several
 * retargets is therefore not variance — it is a bug in how the window is being measured.
 *
 * <p>The symptom is a chain that feels stuck: difficulty 21% high makes the real block interval
 * ~17 minutes against a published ~14, so the mempool panel reads "running long" most of the time
 * and the strip's gaps stretch.
