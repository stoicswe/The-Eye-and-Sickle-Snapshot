/**
 * The anti-dead-end guarantee: <b>the first sweep a new player runs always returns at least three
 * workable targets.</b>
 *
 * <h2>Why this file is a guarantee and not a tuning</h2>
 *
 * The problem being fixed is that discovery was unusable at the start. A probabilistic fix — nudging
 * the base sweep's detection rate up until a new player "usually" found something — would leave a
 * fraction of seeds producing a character with nothing to do and no way to tell that anything was
 * wrong. So the floor is applied deterministically, after every roll: the three guaranteed contacts
 * are forced to {@code detectRoll = 0.0}, which is below the base sweep's <em>worst</em> threshold
 * (0.35 — a quiet machine at one hop), so they are found on every seed, forever.
 *
 * <p>Ten thousand seeds, because "usually" is exactly the failure mode this file exists to rule out.
 */

    /**
     * The headline guarantees get the full sample; the supporting ones get a smaller one.
     *
     * <p>The split is deliberate rather than lazy. Sixty thousand world generations in one test class
     * is a slow suite, and a slow suite gets run less — which costs more coverage than the extra
     * seeds buy. The two properties a new player would actually notice failing are checked at ten
     * thousand; the structural ones that support them are checked at two, where a systematic break
     * still cannot hide.
