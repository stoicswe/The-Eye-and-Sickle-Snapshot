/**
 * The rig's compute ceiling: 24 → 32 → 48 → 64.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ CAPACITY IS DERIVED FROM WHAT IS HELD, NEVER READ FROM THE SAVE'S OWN NUMBER</h2>
 *
 * {@code rig.totalCycles} is a <b>cache</b> of {@link #capacityOf}, reconciled on load and after
 * every upgrade. It is not the authority, and the reason is a bug this codebase has already shipped
 * once: {@code ChainState.networkHashrate} was a stored copy of a derived balance value, it went
 * stale against a re-tune, and a real character mined at 71% of the published rate <b>forever</b>
 * with no readout saying so. A stored capacity fails the same way and worse — it is also the number
 * a hand-edited save would raise to grant itself the whole ladder for free.
 *
 * <p>So the ceiling is a function of the upgrade items in the vault, and {@link #reconcile} is the
 * one place that writes it. {@code ComputeLadderTest.theCacheAlwaysAgreesWithTheLadder} pins that.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ THE FIRST RUNG IS BOUGHT AND THE REST ARE NOT — this is Invariant I1, amended</h2>
 *
 * I1 reads "compute is never purchasable with ethecoin", because otherwise mining buys mining
 * capacity and the master scarcity becomes a compounding flywheel. On explicit direction
 * (2026-08-06, {@code design/15} §3) exactly <b>one</b> rung is purchasable: 24 → 32, at
 * {@link Balance#COMPUTE_32_PRICE}.
 *
 * <p>⚠ <b>One rung cannot close the loop.</b> The flywheel needs mine → buy capacity → mine faster →
 * buy <em>more</em> capacity, and the step above 32 cannot be bought at any price. Money moves a
 * player up once, ever. That is a head start, not a compounding one — and the difference is the
 * entire safety argument, so it is enforced by a test rather than by this paragraph.
