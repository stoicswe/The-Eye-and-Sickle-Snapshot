/**
 * The single-player game, as one object.
 *
 * <h2>What this is</h2>
 *
 * A rules engine over a {@link GameSave}, with no framework, no database, no thread and no socket.
 * The client owns the clock: it calls {@link #tick(Instant)} on a JavaFX timeline and this class
 * advances mining, recovery and heat. Nothing here starts a thread of its own, which is what keeps
 * "single player" from quietly becoming "a server you did not know you were running".
 *
 * <h2>The catch-up rule</h2>
 *
 * {@link #resume(Instant)} applies elapsed real time on load, which is what makes deployed miners
 * (the only offline income, Invariant I5) work at all. It is also where the buffer cap earns its
 * keep: a player returning after a week gets four hours of yield per miner, not a week's, because the
 * cap bit almost immediately. Without the catch-up the mechanic would be dead; without the cap it
 * would trivialise the economy.
 *
 * <h2>What it deliberately cannot do</h2>
 *
 * There is no method here that federates, exports for trade, or mints a provenance chain. A solo
 * character is local-only ({@code docs/architecture/02} §4), and the way that is enforced is that the
 * capability does not exist rather than that a flag is checked.
