/**
 * What the machines and the people on them are called.
 *
 * <h2>Two pools, one rule: derived from the address, never drawn</h2>
 *
 * Neither name costs an RNG draw. {@code TopologyGenerator}'s class note makes the draw count a pure
 * function of the world's shape — "draw unconditionally, discard conditionally" — and a name is
 * chosen once per host, so a draw here would add one per machine and re-roll every existing world.
 * {@code DocumentPool} already solves this exact problem the same way and for the same reason: hash
 * the address, index the pool. Determinism comes from the address, which is unique by construction,
 * so a machine has the same name on every load without anything being stored to make it so.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ FNV-1a, never {@code String.hashCode} — and this is measured, not assumed</h2>
 *
 * Addresses differ only in their last octet, and {@code String.hashCode} is {@code 31·h + c}, so
 * consecutive addresses land a fixed distance apart and a modulo walks the pool in lockstep with the
 * host index. Measured against the eight-name list this replaces, on the real address scheme:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   hashCode: wren dana kai morgan riley sasha toma ves morgan riley
 *   FNV-1a  : kai morgan riley sasha toma ves wren dana riley dana
 * </pre>
 *
 * The first row is the pool in order. Every server's operators arrived in the same rotation, offset
 * by the server index — so a player who learned one server's sequence knew every other server's, and
 * the "random" name was an index in disguise. {@code DocumentPool} carries the same warning about the
 * same trap; this is the second time it has bitten, which is why the hash lives here rather than in
 * each caller.
 *
 * <h2>The machine name is Docker's scheme, and the adjective rule is Docker's too</h2>
 *
 * {@code adjective-pioneer}, after {@code docker/pkg/namesgenerator} — an adjective and a figure from
 * computing, mathematics, physics, quantum mechanics or astronomy. It reads as a real fleet naming
 * convention because it is one, and it is a convention a player can go and meet on their own machine
 * the first time they run a container.
 *
 * <p>⚠ <b>NO ADJECTIVE MAY BE DEMEANING, and that is a hard rule rather than taste.</b> These are
 * real people; most of the pool is dead and a good deal of it is not, and pairing a real name with an
 * insult is a claim about a person the game has no business making. Docker learned this in public:
 * its generator carries a special case excluding {@code boring_wozniak}, with the comment that Steve
 * Wozniak is not boring. A rule over the whole list is the version of that fix which cannot be
 * defeated by adding one more word.
 *
 * <p>⚠ <b>The rule is "not demeaning", NOT "complimentary"</b> — widened on explicit direction, and
 * the distinction is the whole of it. Atmosphere is welcome and the pool is deliberately moody and a
 * little suggestive, because this is a game about breaking into other people's machines at night:
 * {@code sultry}, {@code roguish}, {@code wicked}, {@code clandestine}, {@code illicit-adjacent} words
 * all read as flavour on a hostname. What stays out is anything that would read as a <em>judgement of
 * the person</em> — incompetent, dull, ugly, cowardly, and the obvious slurs. The test for a candidate
 * is not "is it polite" but "would the surname's owner object to being described this way".
 *
 * <p>⚠ <b>Surnames only, and no name carrying a hyphen or a space.</b> Three reasons and each one is
 * load-bearing: the separator is a hyphen, so {@code bold-berners-lee} cannot be split back into its
 * two halves by anything reading it; RFC 1123 governs the result, because these names reach
 * {@code Hostname}'s vocabulary and a space is not a legal host label; and a bare surname makes no
 * claim about the person beyond the surname existing, so nothing here can state a real-world fact
 * that {@code docs/education}'s verification rule would have to stand behind.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ A machine name must NOT encode what the machine is</h2>
 *
 * Carried over from {@code HostArchetypes.hostLabel}, which this replaces, and it is the constraint
 * that decides the scheme. Naming a node's type is what the 15 EC Passive Sniffer sells
 * ({@code docs/design/07-recon-tools.md} §1), so a label like {@code sentry-04} would hand out a
 * purchased tool's entire product at the moment of discovery.
 *
 * <p>The scheme this replaced leaked it in a quieter way, which is worth recording because it is the
 * kind of thing that survives review: labels were {@code <server>-<index>} and the generator makes
 * host index 0 the gateway on every server, always. So {@code home-relay-00} was a free, reliable
 * "this is the gateway" for anyone who noticed the pattern — the sniffer's answer, given away by a
 * counter. An adjective and a surname correlate with nothing.

    /**
     * The people. Ordinary given names, lowercase, short enough to be real Unix account names.
     *
     * <h2>The pool is deliberately not from one place</h2>
     *
     * English, Nordic and Romance names were the original set; Korean, Japanese and Norwegian names were
     * added on explicit direction, then Chinese and Russian ones. A surveillance state's network is staffed by whoever
     * lives there, and a machine room where everybody is called Dana or Morgan reads as a set built
     * from one writer's address book.
     *
     * <p>⚠ <b>SEVEN CHARACTERS IS A HARD CEILING, and it is a LAYOUT contract, not a style rule.</b>
     * The account name shares the network map's address line with the address itself, and that line
     * is {@code UiTokens.NET_NODE_COLS} = 18 glyph cells: one for the selection gutter, up to nine for
     * the widest address this scheme can produce ({@code 10.6.0.51}, at the published cap of fifty
     * machines a server), one separator, leaving <b>seven</b>. An eighth character does not wrap, it
     * is silently clipped by {@code NetCanvas}, so a name would lose its last letter on the primary
     * surface with nothing reporting it. {@code ragnhild} and {@code torbjorn} were dropped from the
     * Norwegian set for exactly this and for no other reason. {@code NpcNamesTest} pins the ceiling.
     *
     * <p>⚠ <b>Deliberately not de-collided across the world.</b> Two machines each having an operator
     * called {@code dana} is what a network of a few hundred people actually looks like, and a
     * username is namespaced by the machine it is on — {@code dana@10.2.0.7} and {@code dana@10.4.0.3}
     * are not ambiguous. Forcing uniqueness would make the name a hidden identifier for the host,
     * which is the opposite of what it is.

     * The characters. What a SERVER is named after — {@code adjective-character}.
     *
     * <h2>Fictional on purpose, where the machines' pool is real on purpose</h2>
     *
     * {@link #PIONEERS} is scientists and mathematicians, and it carries a hard rule because those
     * are real people: <b>no adjective may be demeaning</b>, because pairing a real name with an
     * insult is a claim about a person the game has no business making. This pool is the other case
     * entirely — every name here belongs to a character in a game or a novel — so the rule that binds
     * it is a different one, and both halves of that difference matter.
     *
     * <p>⚠ <b>What is still forbidden: a REAL person's name.</b> The generated set was reviewed for
     * exactly this and three were dropped — {@code blavatsky} (a historical occultist, not a game
     * character), {@code zidane} (Final Fantasy IX's protagonist, and also a very famous living
     * footballer, and it is the footballer a hostname would read as), and {@code bohemond} (a real
     * crusader). ⚠ {@code heisenberg} was dropped by the collision check rather than by review, and
     * the reason is worth keeping: Resident Evil Village has a Karl Heisenberg, {@link #PIONEERS} has
     * Werner Heisenberg, and a name in both pools reads as the physicist wherever it appears.
     *
     * <p>⚠ <b>And a species is not a character.</b> {@code necron}, {@code pfhor} and {@code jjaro}
     * were harvested and removed: {@code wicked-necron} names a race rather than a person, which is
     * the one way this pool can read as something other than a name.
     *
     * <h2>⚠ ORDINARY GIVEN NAMES AND COMMON WORDS ARE OUT, and that is what makes the scheme work</h2>
     *
     * A hostname reads as a reference only if the second half is distinctive. {@code wicked-sam},
     * {@code wicked-paul} and {@code wicked-storm} are not references to Death Stranding, Dune or
     * anything else — they are an adjective and an ordinary word. So Sam Porter Bridges is absent and
     * Paul Atreides appears as {@code muaddib} and as {@code atreides}, which are.
     *
     * <p>⚠ Seven more were dropped for colliding with {@link #OPERATORS} — {@code anya}, {@code
     * magnus}, {@code vlad} and friends. An account name and a server name are different namespaces
     * and would not actually be ambiguous, but a player who has just met an operator called
     * {@code magnus} and then finds a server called {@code roguish-magnus} will reasonably think the
     * two are connected, and they are not.
     *
     * <h2>How it was built</h2>
     *
     * Harvested across the fifteen franchises named in the request — Final Fantasy, Zelda, Cyberpunk
     * 2077/Edgerunners, Cronos: The New Dawn, Marathon, Portal, Half-Life, Death Stranding, Tomb
     * Raider, Resident Evil, Watch Dogs, Wolfenstein, Doom, Warhammer 40,000, Warhammer
     * Fantasy/Age of Sigmar and Dune — then filtered mechanically (a–z only, 3–12 characters, one
     * word, no collision with the other three pools) and reviewed for invented names, real people,
     * species-not-characters and words that read as adjectives.
     *
     * <p>⚠ <b>3–12 characters, and the ceiling is a layout figure.</b> A server name reaches the
     * map's tab strip and its header line, where {@link #OPERATORS}' much tighter seven-character
     * rule does not apply — that one is the network map's 18-cell address line. Twelve is what keeps
     * a row of tabs from wrapping at the panel's smallest usable width.
     *
     * <p>⚠ <b>Names, not text.</b> Nothing here reproduces anything from those works: a proper noun
     * is not the work, and this pool states no fact about any of them — which is the same bar
     * {@link #PIONEERS} clears by carrying surnames alone.

     * The name of a <b>server</b>: {@code adjective-character}.
     *
     * <h2>Why servers have their own pool</h2>
     *
     * A server name is the one place in this world a player reads a <em>place</em> rather than a
     * machine. It reaches them on the map's tab strip, on the header line, and — most importantly —
     * out of a <b>bridge</b>, which advertises the network on its far side and nothing else
     * ({@code docs/design/17} §3.1). So it wants to sound like somewhere to go, and the machines'
     * pool of scientists does not: {@code wicked-turing} is a box, and a player who saw it on a tab
     * would reasonably think a tab was a machine.
     *
     * <p>⚠ <b>The scheme is deliberately identical.</b> {@code adjective-noun}, hashed from the id,
     * de-collided by walking — the same shape as {@link #machine}, so the world reads as one naming
     * convention with two vocabularies rather than as two conventions. The adjectives are shared, and
     * they are shared on purpose: they have already been through the "not demeaning" rule, and a
     * second adjective list is a second place for that rule to be forgotten.
     *

     * same seven places, in the same order, on every seed, because the generation sequence has no
     * draw slot for a server name. Two players comparing worlds found identical place names attached
     * to different shapes. Hashing the id gives a different set per world at no cost in draws.
     *
     * <h2>⚠ THE SALT IS THE WHOLE POINT, AND WITHOUT IT THIS PROMISE WAS FALSE (fixed 2026-08-10)</h2>
     *
     * The paragraph above says hashing the id "gives a different set per world". <b>It did not.</b> A
     * server id is {@code HostArchetypes.serverId(index)} — the literal {@code "srv-0"}, {@code
     * "srv-1"} — an index and nothing else, identical in every world ever generated. So a hash of it
     * is identical too: <b>every</b> character's home server was called {@code candid-noctilus}, and
     * the seven fixed names this replaced had simply been swapped for seven different fixed names.
     * The defect survived because the naming reads as random and is only visible by comparing two
     * worlds.
     *
     * <p>{@code worldSalt} is what carries the per-world entropy the id never had. It is prepended
     * rather than appended because FNV-1a mixes forward: a difference in the first bytes avalanches
     * through the whole digest, where a difference in the last ones reaches the high bits only weakly
     * — which is the trap {@link AddressHash#unitOf} already records from the other side.
     *
     * <p>⚠ <b>Still zero draws.</b> The salt is the character id, which is fixed before the world is
     * generated and never moves, so this is the same pure function of the save it always was — it
     * simply has the save's identity in it now. Nothing about the RNG contract changes.
     *
     * @param worldSalt what makes two worlds name their servers differently — the character id
     * @param serverId the id to derive from — stable, unique, and already the join key

     *
     * <h2>Why a bridge's operator is not drawn from {@link #OPERATORS} like everyone else's</h2>
     *
     * A bridge is the one machine whose whole meaning is somewhere else, and this makes it say so in
     * the one place a player is already reading — the account in the prompt and on the node box. Where
     * an ordinary machine's operator is an ordinary person, a bridge is run by whoever the far side is
     * named for, so {@code roguish-muaddib} is reached through a machine whose account is
     * {@code muaddib}. It turns the identity finding into a second, quieter way of learning what is on
     * the other side of a door.
     *
     * <h2>⚠ The pools cannot collide, and that is asserted rather than assumed</h2>
     *
     * {@code NpcNamesTest.poolsDoNotOverlap} already holds {@link #CHARACTERS} and {@link #OPERATORS}
     * disjoint, which was written for a different reason (a player who just met an operator called
     * {@code magnus} would read {@code roguish-magnus} as connected to them). It pays off here: an
     * account name from this pool is one an ordinary machine could never have, so a bridge's account
     * is recognisably not a member of the ordinary crew.
     *
     * <h2>⚠ IT CAN EXCEED THE SEVEN-CHARACTER OPERATOR BUDGET, and the map clips it</h2>
     *
     * {@link #OPERATORS} is capped at seven because the node box's address line has exactly that much
     * room after the address and a separator. {@link #CHARACTERS} is not — it is capped at twelve for
     * the tab strip — so {@code amendiares} clips on the box. That is the treatment a machine
     * <em>name</em> already gets there for the same reason, clipped from the right because a name is
     * read from its front, with the full string on the tooltip, in the host list and in the recon
     * file. The alternative was to restrict which characters may name a bridged server, which would
     * make the server pool depend on a client layout constant.
     *
     * @param serverName the far side's name, {@code adjective-character}
