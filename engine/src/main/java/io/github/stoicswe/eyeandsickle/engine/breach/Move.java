/**
 * What one class rule hands back to {@link BreachRules} after resolving a move.
 *
 * <h2>Why the three class rules do not touch the breach's bookkeeping</h2>
 *
 * Attention, strikes, noise, the ledger and the layer's lifecycle are the same in all three classes,
 * and {@code docs/design/05-hacking-minigame.md} §4 makes them the same on purpose — the per-action
 * cost table is one table, not two. So {@link MatrixRules} and {@link OffsetRules} decide only what
 * <em>happened</em>, and {@link BreachRules} decides what that costs. A class rule that charged its
 * own attention would be a third place for the cost table to drift, and drift in that table is the
 * "comprehensible failure" constraint failing quietly.
 *
 * @param result what came back, in words, for the ledger row — never a code
 * @param strike whether this tripped an alarm
 * @param extraNoise noise beyond what the action's kind already costs; canaries add here
 * @param refunded whether the whole charge is handed back; see {@link #refunded(String)}
 * @param cleared whether the layer is now solved
 * @param locked whether the layer is now unplayable — see {@link #locked(String)}
 * @param bookkeeping whether this was composition rather than a move — never charged, never ledgered
 * @param consequence a line for the resolution's consequence list, or {@code ""}
