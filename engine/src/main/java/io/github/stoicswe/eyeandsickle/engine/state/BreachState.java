/**
 * A breach attempt in progress, or one that has resolved and not yet been dismissed.
 *
 * <h2>Why this needs no settlement path</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/05-hacking-minigame.md} §4 decided the breach is <b>turn-based, with no wall
 * clock anywhere in it</b>. Nothing here has a deadline, so nothing here can finish while the game
 * is closed, so there is nothing for {@code GameEngine.resume()} or {@code settleTasks} to settle. A
 * breach survives a quit for free: it is a document, and reloading it puts the player back on the
 * same turn.
 *
 * <p>That is worth stating explicitly because it is the <em>opposite</em> of {@link TaskState},
 * which sits two files away and exists entirely to model work with a deadline. A future reader
 * looking for "where does the breach settle" should find this paragraph instead of a bug.
 *
 * <h2>The compute is held, not spent (D-5)</h2>
 *
 * {@link #allocationId} names one {@code ACTIVE_TOOL} reservation that is held for the whole attempt
 * and released into recovery at resolution — exactly the scan's hold-then-recover shape (UI-6,
 * {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.2). Because it is a plain allocation and not a task, it needs
 * no clock either.
 *
 * <h2>Resolution lives here until dismissed</h2>
 *
 * The {@code resolved*} fields below are filled at resolution and this object is <em>not</em>
 * cleared — {@code dismiss} does that. So the outcome slate survives a reload, which matters
 * because the slate is where a loss becomes comprehensible ({@code 05} §1 constraint 4) and a
 * player who quits in disgust and comes back deserves to still be able to read why.
