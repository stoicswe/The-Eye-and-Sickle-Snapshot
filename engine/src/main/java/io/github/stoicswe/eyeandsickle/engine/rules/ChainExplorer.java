/**
 * The chain as a block explorer renders it: addresses, hashes, blocks and transactions.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Everything here is DERIVED. Nothing here decides anything.</h2>
 *
 * This class turns state that already exists — a height, a winner, a ledger row — into the shapes an
 * explorer draws. It rolls no dice, awards no coins and changes no balances. That separation is the
 * whole reason it is not part of {@code ChainRules}: a presentation layer that could quietly mint a
 * transaction would be a second, invisible economy.
 *
 * <h2>Why a hash can be computed instead of stored</h2>
 *
 * A real block's hash is the thing the miner searched for, so it has to be recorded. Here there is no
 * search — the winner is drawn — so a block's hash carries no information and only has to be
 * <em>stable</em>: the same height must render the same hash every time it is asked for. A digest
 * over {@code (blockSeed, height)} gives exactly that for no storage at all, which is what lets the
 * save keep two dozen blocks and still answer for any height a ledger row names.
 *
 * <p>The seed is per-character. Without it every save would render identical hashes at identical
 * heights, and the chain would read as a shared fixture rather than each character's own world.
 *
 * <h2>Ethereum's shapes, this chain's meanings</h2>
 *
 * Addresses are 20 bytes and hashes are 32, {@code 0x}-prefixed and lower-case hex, because that is
 * what a reader recognises. The header fields are pre-Merge Ethereum's, which was a proof-of-work
 * chain and therefore had all of them honestly. Gas is real arithmetic and not decoration: every
 * transaction on this chain is a plain value transfer, which is the 21 000 gas Ethereum charges for
 * one, so a block's {@code gasUsed} is its transaction count times 21 000 and nothing else.

     *
     * Every card was 14.0 minutes after the one below it, twenty-four times, forever. Measured, and
     * reported as the chain looking like a metronome. The old comment defended it — "a history with
     * plausible-looking random gaps would be inventing a past the chain never had" — which is a fair
     * argument and lost to the fact that a perfectly even chain is *also* an invented past, and an
     * obviously false one. Real proof-of-work never produces two identical intervals in a row.
     *
     * <h2>The jitter is applied to the position, not to the interval, and that is the whole trick</h2>
     *
     * Each height is displaced by up to {@link #TIMESTAMP_JITTER_SECONDS} either way, derived from
     * its own height. Adjacent gaps therefore come out at
     * {@code mean + jitter(h) − jitter(h − 1)} — inside {@code 14 ± 6} minutes, so <b>8 to 20</b>
     * with the peak at 14. Three properties fall out of doing it this way rather than by summing
     * per-block intervals:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>O(1).</b> A summed history would need every interval between the tip and the height
     *       asked for. {@link #body} calls this once per transaction and a full strip is ~4800 calls,
     *       so a walk of even a few dozen digests each would be tens of thousands of hashes a frame.
     *   <li><b>Monotone by construction.</b> The smallest possible gap is
     *       {@code mean − 2 × jitter}, which stays comfortably positive — no block can ever render
     *       before its own parent, which a naive per-height random offset would eventually do.
     *   <li><b>The mean is exactly the published interval.</b> The jitters telescope over any span,
     *       so the strip cannot drift away from the "a block every ~14 min" printed above it.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>⚠ The tip's own jitter is subtracted, so the newest block renders at exactly
     * {@code lastBlockAt}. That one timestamp is a <b>measurement</b> — the chain really did record
     * it — and displacing it would put the explorer minutes out of step with the mempool panel's
     * "last one 3m ago", which is derived from the same field.
     *
     * <p>⚠ The band is deliberately <b>narrower than the live process</b>, which is exponential and
     * measured at 0 → 95 minutes with a median of 10.3. This is a back-dated derivation of a history
     * nobody watched, and its job is to look like a chain rather than to be a second sampler of the
     * distribution; the honest readout of the real distribution is the mempool panel's estimate and
     * its percentile, which are computed from the live process. If the two are ever asked to agree,
