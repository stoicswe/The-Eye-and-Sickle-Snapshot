/**
 * The filesystem every machine in the game appears to have.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Nothing here touches a real filesystem, and that is a safety boundary</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/client/04-terminology-and-education.md} §3.1 rule 3 forbids concatenating anything a
 * player types into a host filesystem call. Every path in this class is a key into a tree computed on
 * demand; no {@code java.io} or {@code java.nio} type appears anywhere in the package. That mattered
 * when the surface was a shell printing {@code /rig/storage/vault}; it matters more now that it is a
 * file manager, because a file manager is precisely the widget that makes a path look openable.
 *
 * <h2>Generated, never stored</h2>
 *
 * A host's tree is derived from its address and its state each time it is asked for. Two reasons, and
 * the second is the load-bearing one:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Fifty hosts × a hundred entries is five thousand records in a save file that is meant to be
 *       small enough to read by hand.
 *   <li><b>A generated tree cannot drift from the rules.</b> A miner appears in {@code /etc/systemd}
 *       because {@code deployedMiners} is non-empty, and it stops appearing the moment the miner is
 *       killed — there is no second copy of that fact to forget to update. A stored tree would be a
 *       cache of game state and would eventually disagree with it, and the surface it disagreed on
 *       would be the one the player uses to decide whether a machine has been tampered with.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Determinism comes from seeding on the address, so the same machine has the same filesystem
 * across a reload — a host whose directory listing reshuffled every visit would make "was this here
 * before?" unanswerable, which is the question {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.1 is built on.
 *
 * <h2>Ubuntu's layout, because it is the one worth learning</h2>
 *
 * The tree is the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard as Ubuntu ships it: {@code /etc} for configuration,
 * {@code /var/log} for logs, {@code /home/<user>} for people, {@code /usr/bin} for programs,
 * {@code /mnt} for things mounted by hand. Every one of those is real and transfers to any Linux
 * machine the player ever touches, which is the cheapest teaching in the client — nobody has to be
 * told what {@code /var/log} is if they have already gone looking in it for something.
 *
 * <p>⚠ It is <b>simplified</b>, and It is simplified and the simplifications are: no permissions
 * model that actually gates anything (the rules decide readability, not a mode string), no inodes, no
 * hard links, and a much smaller {@code /usr}. The layout is true; the depth is not.
