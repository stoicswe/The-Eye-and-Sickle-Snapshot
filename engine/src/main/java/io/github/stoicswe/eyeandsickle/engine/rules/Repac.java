/**
 * What happens to a file after it arrives: repacking, installing, and reselling.
 *
 * <h2>The three-step life of a stolen upgrade</h2>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   somebody's machine    ~/Downloads          ~/Downloads      Applications/…/Upgrades
 *   sweep-wide.pkg   ──▶  sweep-wide.pkg  ──▶  sweep-wide.upg ──▶  owned, installed
 *                 download            Repac              double-click
 *                                                             │
 *                                                             └──▶ or SOLD, and never installed
 * </pre>
 *
 * <b>Repac</b> is the rig's own packaging tool. It is not a window and the player never runs it —
 * it fires the moment an upgrade payload lands and turns a vendor package into something this rig
 * can install. It exists as a named step rather than as silent magic for one reason: a player who
 * watches {@code sweep-wide.pkg} become {@code sweep-wide.upg} and reads the log line saying which
 * tool did it has learned that a downloaded package is not the same object as an installed program.
 * That is a real and frequently-missing distinction, and it costs one log line to teach.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Installing is optional, and that is the whole economy</h2>
 *
 * A {@code .upg} is an <b>asset</b>. Installing consumes it; selling it does not require ever having
 * wanted it. That is what makes stealing an upgrade you already own worth doing, and it is the
 * incentive the secondary market exists to create.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ [PROPOSAL] Only ETHECOIN-gated upgrades may be resold, and this is Invariant I2</h2>
 *
 * If a schematic-gated tool could be stolen and sold for ethecoin, then <b>anyone with enough
 * ethecoin could buy a ceiling</b> — which is exactly what <b>I2</b> forbids, and <b>I8</b> forbids
 * for zero-days. Resale is therefore restricted to items whose gate is <em>already</em>
 * {@link UnlockGate#ETHECOIN}: money reselling a money-gated item opens no route that was not open,
 * and the player economy still gets the large class of items that band covers.
 *
 * <p>Everything else can still be <b>stolen and used</b> — raiding is an established acquisition
 * route ({@code docs/design/01-core-resources.md} §6) and nothing here changes it. What is refused is
 * turning a gated item into currency. See {@code docs/design/15} for the alternative that was
 * rejected and why.
