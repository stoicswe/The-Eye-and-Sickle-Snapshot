/**
 * Which build of a tool a given machine is carrying, and what that is worth.
 *
 * <h2>What a version is for</h2>
 *
 * Before this existed, every upgrade sitting in somebody's {@code Contents/Upgrades} was
 * interchangeable with every other copy of the same tool: a player who already owned the Wide Sweep
 * had no reason to look at another one, and no reason to prefer a hard target over an easy one when
 * both carried the same item. A version makes the same tool on two different machines two different
 * propositions.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ A newer build is worth more and supersedes an older one. It is NOT a better tool.</h2>
 *
 * See {@link UpgradeVersion} for the full argument. In short: a capability that rises with the
 * hardness of the machine you take it off is a ceiling with no gate on it, reachable by grinding —
 * Invariant <b>I2</b> arriving from an unexpected direction, and <b>I3</b> broken as well because the
 * item would then sit behind its catalogue gate <em>and</em> a raiding ladder. Nothing here touches
 * {@code equippedCycles}, detection probability, hop reach or any other capability figure, and
 * {@code UpgradeVersionTest} asserts that a version never reaches one.
 *
 * <h2>Where the number comes from</h2>
 *
 * Deterministic from the item and the host, never drawn. The same machine carries the same build
 * every time you look at it, which is what makes "was this here before?" and "is theirs newer than
 * mine?" answerable at all — and it is the same rule {@code VirtualFs.upgradeBytes} already follows
 * for the same reason.
 *
 * <p>⚠ <b>The major number tracks the HOST's tier, and that is the whole reward loop.</b> A tier-5
 * machine runs newer software than a tier-1 desktop, which is both true of real estates and exactly
 * the incentive this feature exists to create: raid harder targets to find newer builds. The minor
 * number is scattered off the item and address so two tier-3 machines are not carrying identical
 * copies.

     * <p>⚠ Tier drives the major, so the ladder is legible: a player who notices that the good stuff
     * sits on hard machines has learned the rule without being told it. The offset means a tier-1
     * machine is on {@code v1.x} rather than {@code v0.x} — a zero major reads as a prerelease, and
     * nothing in this world ships one.
