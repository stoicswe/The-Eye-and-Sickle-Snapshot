/**
 * Breach Protocol: pick a code, the path turns, the buffer fills, and nothing can be taken back.
 *
 * <h2>The whole game in one sentence</h2>
 *
 * Every pick both <em>appends</em> to a buffer that cannot be emptied and <em>constrains</em> the
 * next pick to a single row or column — so the player is choosing a path through a grid where each
 * step decides what the next step may be, with a hard limit on how many steps there are.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Open information, and it stays open</h2>
 *
 * The grid, the goals and the buffer are all published from the first frame ({@code MatrixBoard}), so
 * this class has nothing to hide and no secret to keep. That makes it the exact opposite of a
 * deduction game and it is why there is no probe action here: there is nothing to ask. A player who
 * can see everything and still cannot find a path that lands two sequences inside six slots has been
 * beaten by the puzzle rather than by what they were not told.
 *
 * <p>What this class must <b>never</b> publish is a solution — no reachable-goal count, no "best next
 * cell", no marker on the cell a solver would take. Working that out is the entire game.
 *
 * <h2>Why a wasted pick is not a strike</h2>
 *
 * Taking a code that advances nothing is already punished: it spends one of a very small number of
 * buffer slots and it moves the cursor somewhere the player did not choose. Charging a strike on top
 * would punish the same mistake twice and would make an exploratory pick — sometimes the only legal
 * move — read as an error. Strikes here are reserved for <em>illegal</em> picks, which the client
 * cannot make and a hand-typed command can.
