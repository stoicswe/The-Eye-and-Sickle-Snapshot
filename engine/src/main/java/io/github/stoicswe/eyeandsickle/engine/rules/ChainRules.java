/**
 * Proof of work, done properly: difficulty, the retarget, and the exponential wait.
 *
 * <h2>The three equations, and they are the real ones</h2>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   expected hashes per block   = difficulty × 2^32
 *   expected seconds to a block = difficulty × 2^32 / hashrate
 *   difficulty holding interval = interval × networkHashrate / 2^32
 * </pre>
 *
 * The first is Bitcoin's, exactly — its difficulty-1 target makes the expected hash count
 * {@code difficulty × 2^48 / 0xffff}, which is {@code difficulty × 2^32} to within one part in
 * 65 536. The second is the first divided by a rate. The third is the second rearranged to solve for
 * the difficulty that holds a chosen block interval, which is what a retarget does.
 *
 * <p>Keeping the real constants means the arithmetic in {@code docs/education/07} checks out against
 * a live block explorer. Inventing a tidier constant would have made every worked example in the
 * curriculum false, and {@code CLAUDE.md} treats teaching something false as worse than teaching
 * nothing.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Every wait here is drawn, never scheduled</h2>
 *
 * {@link #drawWork} returns a sample from {@code Exp(1)} by inverse transform: if {@code U} is
 * uniform on (0,1] then {@code -ln U} is exponential with mean 1. Progress is then measured in
 * <em>expected blocks</em> rather than in hashes, so a difficulty change re-rates the accrual instead
 * of invalidating the outstanding draw — which is what makes the pool's vardiff retune (and the
 * player's own reallocation) free of both penalty and exploit.
 *
 * <p>A scheduled interval with noise added would look identical for about ten minutes and then
 * diverge: it would have a bounded tail, it would not be memoryless, and the pooled-versus-solo
 * choice — which is <em>entirely</em> a choice about the shape of that tail — would stop meaning
 * anything.

     * that carried it. A transaction left unconfirmed across a four-day absence would be the lie, and
     * would also mean a player could park money in the mempool to hide it.
