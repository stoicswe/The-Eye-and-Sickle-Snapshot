/**
 * The root of a single-player save.
 *
 * <p>This is a plain mutable tree on purpose. It is the <em>serialization</em> shape, not the domain
 * model the UI sees: the engine reads it, applies rules, and hands the client immutable {@code
 * protocol} value types. Keeping the two apart means the save format can gain a field without every
 * screen in the client learning about it, and it means Jackson never has to be taught how to
 * construct a {@link io.github.stoicswe.eyeandsickle.protocol.game.Cycles}.
 *
 * <h2>This file is player-controlled infrastructure, and that is the whole point</h2>
 *
 * A player can open this file in a text editor and give themselves a thousand ethecoin. That is not a
 * vulnerability to be closed — it is a single-player game, the only person affected is the person
 * doing it, and every anti-tamper measure available here is theatre against an attacker who owns the
 * machine.
 *
 * <p>What matters is that this can never become <em>someone else's</em> problem. {@link #federable}
 * is permanently {@code false} for a locally-created character, and the client refuses to submit a
 * save-derived item to any federated server. Invariant I14 is preserved not by pretending this file
 * is trustworthy but by ensuring nothing downstream ever trusts it.
