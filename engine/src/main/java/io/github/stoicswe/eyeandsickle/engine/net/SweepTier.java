/**
 * The three sweep tiers, and the one thing they all have in common: <b>none of them changes the hop
 * ceiling.</b>
 *
 * <h2>Schematics buy reach, ethecoin buys sensitivity</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/07-recon-tools.md} §2 makes the Topology Mapper "a <b>ceiling</b> on information
 * (1 hop → 2 hops), hence schematic-gated not purchasable (Invariant I2)". Every row here leaves the
 * ceiling at one hop and moves only the <em>probability</em> of detecting what is already in reach —
 * which is breadth, and {@code docs/design/02-unlock-gates.md} §1.1 step 4 puts consumables,
 * replaceables and sidegrades on ethecoin. Invariant I2 is satisfied structurally rather than by
 * discipline: this enum carries no reach value, and {@code NetRules.hopCeiling} does not take a tier.
 *
 * <h2>Gate classification, per {@code 02} §1.1's ordered procedure</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>{@link #BASE}</b> — <b>starting kit</b>, the same class as Port Sweep
 *       ({@code docs/design/06-intrusion-tools.md} §2: "the free starting enumerator. Everyone has
 *       it; it's the baseline the Enumeration class is tuned against"). It is not free content, it is
 *       the floor the price of everything else is measured from. Without it a new player has no way to
 *       find the machines next to them, which is the problem this whole system exists to fix.
 *   <li><b>{@link #WIDE}</b>, <b>{@link #DEEP}</b> — <b>ethecoin</b>. They raise no ceiling: no new
 *       hop, no new field, no new class of node. Losing one costs an evening, which is {@code 03}
 *       §2's own rule for the mid-tier band.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>⚠ These ids are deliberately {@code net-sweep*}</h2>
 *
 * Not {@code sweep*}, because {@code port-sweep} already exists in {@code Targets.TOOL_CYCLES} and a
 * near-collision in a map keyed by item id is the kind of bug that shows up as a breach costing three
 * cycles more than the readout said. And these ids must <b>never</b> be added to {@code TOOL_CYCLES}:
 * a sweep tool is not a breach loadout tool, and adding one would silently raise
 * {@code Targets.attemptCycles} for every breach the player ever opens.
