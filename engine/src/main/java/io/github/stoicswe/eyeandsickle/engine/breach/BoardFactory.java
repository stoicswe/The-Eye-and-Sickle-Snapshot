/**
 * Builds the boards an attempt will be played on, once, at commission.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Every draw happens here and is then frozen into the save</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/16-breach-implementation.md} §2: a board decided at commission is a board a
 * reload cannot re-roll. Nothing downstream draws — {@code MatrixRules} and {@code OffsetRules} take
 * no {@code Rng} at all, which is what makes that structural rather than a rule someone remembers.
 *
 * <h2>Which puzzle, and why it is one roll for the whole attempt</h2>
 *
 * The class is drawn once and every layer of the attempt plays it. A target that opened with a
 * protocol grid and followed with a cipher would be two short games rather than one, and would make
 * the deeper layers of a hard target a lottery between "the thing I am good at" and "the thing I am
 * not" — which turns a difficulty tier into a coin flip. One roll per attempt means a player who
 * draws the puzzle they are worse at knows it before they spend anything, and can walk away.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The roll is weighted by what the player knows about the machine</h2>
 *
 * The <b>offset cipher is the default</b>: it is the puzzle that needs nothing from the far side,
 * because deriving an offset from ciphertext is what you do when you have no other handle. Breach
 * Protocol is the puzzle of someone who already knows the host, so the odds of drawing it rise with
 * how much of the port-scan report is filled in — from {@code BREACH_PROTOCOL_SHARE} against a
 * machine nobody has looked at to {@code BREACH_PROTOCOL_SHARE_INFORMED} against a fully scanned one.
 *
 * <p>That is the whole of RECON's mechanical consequence. Before this, a report was intelligence the
 * player read and acted on by hand; now it changes what the breach <em>is</em>. ⚠ It buys a
 * <b>different</b> puzzle rather than an easier one — nothing about the tier, the attention budget,
 * the strike limit or the layer count moves — so it must not become a discount if either puzzle is
 * ever re-tuned.
