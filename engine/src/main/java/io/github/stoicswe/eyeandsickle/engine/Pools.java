/**
 * The pools on this chain. <strong>[PROPOSAL]</strong> — {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §1.3a.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Nothing here dominates anything else, and that is the whole design</h2>
 *
 * There are exactly two axes and they pull against each other:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Fee</b> is expected income, directly and only. A 0.5% pool really does pay more than a
 *       3.5% pool, every hour, forever.
 *   <li><b>Steadiness</b> is variance, and under {@link PoolScheme#PPLNS} it comes from the pool's
 *       <em>size</em>: you are paid when the pool finds a block, so a pool with 5% of the chain pays
 *       you every three hours or so. Under {@link PoolScheme#PPS} it comes from the share target
 *       instead, which is why a small PPS pool smooths just as well as a large one.
 * </ul>
 *
 * So the cheapest pool on this list is also the lumpiest, the steadiest is the priciest, and a
 * player who reads only the fee column will pick the one that behaves most like the solo mining they
 * were trying to avoid. That is a real lesson about real pools and it is the reason the list is not
 * simply sorted by fee.
 *
 * <h2>Why the shares do not add to 100%</h2>
 *
 * They come to 91%. The rest is solo miners and operations too small to list — which is roughly what
 * a real chain looks like, and it is also what keeps a player's own solo mining meaningful: the
 * unpooled remainder is a real place to be rather than an empty one.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Every PPLNS pool must out-hash a maxed player rig</h2>
 *
 * A PPLNS payout is {@code playerHashrate / poolHashrate} of a block, clamped at 1. If a rig ever
 * grew past its own pool, the clamp would fire and the pool would quietly behave like solo mining
 * with a fee attached — the worst of both, and silent. The chain is 1680 cycle-equivalents, so a
 * 100-cycle rig is 6% of it; the smallest PPLNS pool here is 12%, which leaves room for a rig to
 * roughly double before anything degenerates. {@code MiningChainTest.pplnsPoolsOutHashAMaxedRig}
 * fails the build if a re-tune breaks that, because nothing else would notice.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ THE_COMMONS is the anchor and must stay at the economy's fee</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/03-economy.md} §1 prices self-mining at 0.4 EC per cycle-hour, and
 * {@link Balance#chainNetworkHashrate()} is derived from that figure and {@link Balance#POOL_FEE}.
 * The default pool's fee must equal {@code POOL_FEE} or the documented rate stops being the rate a
 * new character actually gets. Every other pool's fee is a deliberate few tenths of a percent either
 * side of it — the whole spread is ±1.5%, which is a real choice and not a re-tune.
