/**
 * The breach: open one, take a turn, resolve it.
 *
 * <h2>Turn-based, and therefore clock-free</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/05-hacking-minigame.md} §4, decided 2026-07-26: "a breach is turn-based. There
 * is no wall clock anywhere in it." Every method here takes a {@code now} for one purpose only —
 * timestamping what it writes — and nothing here has a deadline. That is why a breach needs no
 * settlement path in {@code GameEngine.resume()} or {@code tick()}, and why it survives a quit for
 * free: reloading puts the player back on the same turn.
 *
 * <h2>Attention is spent by doing, not by succeeding</h2>
 *
 * {@link #act} charges the action's cost <em>before</em> it evaluates the move. A probe that finds
 * nothing costs the same as one that finds everything, because §4 prices actions against the target
 * and the target does not know whether you learned anything. The one exception is a tool that never
 * engaged at all — a Rainbow Table against a salted code — which is charged and then fully refunded
 * so that the rule stays "charge first, evaluate second" with a single visible exception rather than
 * a set of actions that might decline.
 *
 * <h2>The ledger is the feature, not the log</h2>
 *
 * Every accepted action appends a row, including ones that achieved nothing and ones the fiction
 * refused. {@code 05} §1 constraint 4 requires a loss to read as <em>"I was too loud"</em> and never
 * as <em>"the game decided"</em>, and §4 puts that requirement here: "the player must always be able
 * to see which action cost what." A strike appends a <b>second</b> row for its penalty, so the
 * three-attention alarm surcharge is attributable to the move that caused it rather than appearing
 * as an unexplained gap in the arithmetic.
 *
 * <h2>Compute is held, then recovered (D-5, UI-6)</h2>
 *
 * An attempt reserves cycles once and holds them for its whole duration, releasing them onto the
 * Thermal Budget curve at resolution — exactly the shape a scan takes since UI-6 ({@code
 * docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.2). It creates no {@link io.github.stoicswe.eyeandsickle.engine.state.TaskState},
 * because there is no duration to model.
