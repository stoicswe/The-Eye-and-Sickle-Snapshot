/**
 * One line in the rig's log.
 *
 * <h2>Real severities, because the numbering teaches something</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/client/04-terminology-and-education.md} §3.10 maps the {@code log} command to
 * {@code journalctl -f} and {@code tail -f}, and specifies that severity glyphs follow <b>RFC 5424's
 * eight levels</b>. Those are the real levels every syslog daemon on earth uses, with the real
 * numbering — {@code 0} is most severe and {@code 7} least, which is backwards from what most people
 * guess and is exactly the sort of small true thing this game exists to teach.
 *
 * <p>A player who learns here that {@code warning} is 4 and {@code debug} is 7 has learned the
 * numbering they will meet in {@code journalctl -p 4}, in a syslog config, and in every logging
 * library's severity enum.
 *
 * <h2>The facility is the subsystem, and it is how a log becomes filterable</h2>
 *
 * Real syslog has facilities ({@code auth}, {@code cron}, {@code daemon}…). This borrows the idea
 * rather than the list: the facility here is which part of the rig spoke — {@code compute},
 * {@code mining}, {@code defense}, {@code storage}, {@code market}. That is what makes
 * {@code log | grep mining} useful, which is the pipeline the whole terminal exists to support.
