/**
 * The programs the rig runs, and which owned items are upgrades to which.
 *
 * <h2>Why this lives in the rules and not in the client</h2>
 *
 * "Which tool does the Wide Net Sweep upgrade?" is a question about the <em>game</em>, not about a
 * window. The client happens to draw one window per program, but the mapping from an item to the
 * thing it improves would still be true in a text-only build — and it has to be true on the server,
 * because whether a remote actor can take a particular upgrade off a particular program is a rules
 * question (see {@code AccessLog}). A copy of this table in the client would be a second answer.
 *
 * <p>⚠ It deliberately does <b>not</b> import anything from the client, and must not. {@code solo}
 * has no view layer, and the day this file mentions a {@code WindowSpec} the rules engine has
 * acquired an opinion about JavaFX.
 *
 * <h2>An app bundle is a real macOS bundle, and that is the teaching</h2>
 *
 * {@code Terminal.app/Contents/uOS/terminal} is very nearly how a macOS application is laid out — a
 * directory with an extension, a {@code Contents} inside it, the executable in a directory named for
 * the operating system, and everything else beside it. ⚠ On a Mac that directory is called
 * {@code MacOS}; here it is {@link #BINARIES}, because these machines are not Macs and a folder
 * claiming otherwise would be the one dishonest thing in an otherwise real layout. A player who learns here that an "application" on a Mac is a
 * <em>folder</em> has learned something true and slightly surprising, which is the bar
 * {@code docs/education/00} §1.2 sets. ⚠ {@code Upgrades/} is <b>ours</b> and is not part of a real
 * bundle — the rest of the layout is real and this one directory is not, which is a distinction a
 * shipped {@code fs(7)} page ought to state and does not yet (noted in {@code docs/design/15}).
