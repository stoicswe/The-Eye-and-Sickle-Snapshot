/**
 * The player's filing of the machines they have found: create, rename, move, remove, file, unfile.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a rules class and not a client feature</h2>
 *
 * It could have lived in the client — nothing here changes a number the game reasons about, and the
 * client already owns window positions and theme choices. It does not, for one reason: a folder names
 * a <b>discovered address</b>, and whether an address has been discovered is a rules question the
 * client is specifically not allowed to answer ({@code docs/client/04-terminology-and-education.md}
 * §3.4, Invariant <b>I14</b>). A client-side folder store would either duplicate {@code knownNodes}
 * or accept whatever address it was handed, and the second of those is a free oracle for the one
 * thing every sweep tier is sold on. Keeping it here also means it travels: the day a home server
 * backs a session, the player's filing arrives with everything else instead of being stranded on the
 * machine that made it.
 *
 * <h2>Refusals, never exceptions</h2>
 *
 * Every mutator returns a {@link Refusal} — empty on success, a sentence on failure. Same contract as
 * {@link NetRules#beginSweep}: the shell prints a refusal and a window shows one, and a rules engine
 * that threw would be deciding how the client reports it. The sentences are the player-facing wording,
 * because the alternative is two vocabularies for the same failure.
 *
 * <h2>Self-healing on read, so a hand-edited save opens</h2>
 *
 * {@link #tree} tolerates a cycle, a missing parent, and a node filed under a folder that is gone. It
 * repairs rather than refuses: an orphan re-roots, a cycle is broken at the deepest edge, a dangling
 * {@code folderId} is cleared. {@code GameSave}'s class comment is explicit that this file belongs to
 * the player and that they may edit it, so every reader here has to survive one that has been edited
 * badly. Refusing to open a save because two folders point at each other would be the wrong trade by
 * a long way.
