/**
 * What the player can breach, and what they would bring to it.
 *
 * <h2>Two kinds of target, and they are not variants of one thing</h2>
 *
 * A <b>crack</b> runs against a foreign miner on the player's own rig ({@code
 * docs/design/04-mining.md} §5.1). It generates no heat on any outcome (Invariant I9), its prize is
 * a buffer that already exists on the player's own disk (a transfer, never a faucet — {@code
 * docs/design/03-economy.md} §5 rule 3), and losing it costs the buffer the player never had. That
 * combination is why §5.1 calls cracking "the strongest early-game teaching vector for the core
 * minigame".
 *
 * <p>An <b>offensive breach</b> runs against a node out in the world. It generates heat, it can trip
 * canaries that tag the player's handle, and it yields items rather than money — because the moment
 * breaching minted ethecoin it would be a faucet, and because ethecoin must never buy a ceiling
 * (Invariants I1 and I2).
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Crack targets are reported DORMANT, and that is a decision (BR-2)</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/02-unlock-gates.md} §2.4 requires proof-of-skill credit to come from "a live or
 * defended target — not a dormant one", and Invariant I7 exists because count-gating "invites
 * farming the weakest available target". A miner squatting on the player's own rig is neither live
 * nor defended: it does not fight back, nothing about it can hurt the player, and it is available
 * on demand as soon as one is planted. Reporting it {@code LIVE} would make the safest action in the
 * game also the proof-of-skill source, which is the exact farming failure the gate was written to
 * prevent. Logged in {@code docs/design/16-breach-implementation.md} §7.

     *
     * <p>These are <b>established</b> numbers, not proposals — they are the "gate, EC cost, compute,
     * noise" stats §1 of {@code 06} calls "first-class balance levers". They live here rather than in
     * {@code Balance} because they are a mapping from item id to a figure another document owns, not
     * a figure this module chose; {@code Balance} is for numbers solo had to decide.

     * confused with {@code port-sweep} in this map. A sweep is a pre-breach recon action with its own
     * duration and its own reservation — it is not part of a breach loadout, and adding one would
     * silently raise {@link #attemptCycles} for every breach the player ever opens, in a number the
     * client renders as the attempt's published cost. {@code NetRules.owns} does the sweep ownership
     * check separately for exactly this reason.
