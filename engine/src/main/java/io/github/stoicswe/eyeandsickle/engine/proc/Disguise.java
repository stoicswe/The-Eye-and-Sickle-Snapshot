/**
 * How a parasite hides in the process table.
 *
 * <h2>Every disguise must be findable by reading, and none by clicking</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.1 gives manual audit its whole job: the discrepancy is always
 * present in the data. That is a promise in two directions and both halves are load-bearing.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Always present.</b> Every disguise below leaves a tell that is <em>in the table</em>, on
 *       the row, visible without any tool. A parasite the player could not have found by looking is
 *       not hiding, it is cheating, and it would teach them that reading the table is pointless.
 *   <li><b>A discrepancy, not a marker.</b> The tell is never a field that means "this one". It is
 *       always a <em>relationship</em> being wrong: a name that does not match any real daemon, a
 *       user no other row uses, a CPU figure that does not match its own accumulated CPU time, two
 *       rows claiming to be one tool. Reading a relationship is the skill; spotting a marker is not.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>⚠ None of these is subtle enough to need a guide, and that is deliberate. The fun is in
 * <em>noticing</em>, which is a two-second act once you know what to look at; making it a
 * ten-minute act would turn the audit into a chore and push players back onto buying scans, which is
 * the opposite of what §3.1 wants. Hard enough that a glance misses it, easy enough that a look
 * finds it.
 *
 * <h2>They are all one of two shapes</h2>
 *
 * A disguise either <b>borrows a name that should be unique</b> or <b>claims a resource story that
 * does not add up</b>. The first is caught by comparing rows to each other, the second by comparing a
 * row to itself. Teaching both is why there are five rather than one.
