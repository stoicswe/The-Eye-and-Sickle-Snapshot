/**
 * One thing downloads at a time, and the player says which.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ THE ACTIVE DOWNLOAD IS DERIVED — the first order that is not paused</h2>
 *
 * Nothing stores which download is running. Ask the list: the head, skipping paused entries. That
 * one decision is why pausing and reordering need no separate machinery — moving an order to the
 * front <em>is</em> starting it, pausing the head <em>is</em> promoting the next one, and there is
 * no combination of the two that can leave a stored flag disagreeing with the list.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ A HELD DOWNLOAD HAS ITS CLOCK PUSHED FORWARD, it is not cancelled</h2>
 *
 * A transfer is a deadline: {@code startedAt}, {@code endsAt}, and wall time doing the rest. There
 * is no way to stop wall time, so holding one means moving <b>both</b> ends forward by however long
 * the hold lasted — which leaves {@code progressAt} reading exactly what it read when the hold
 * began. Shifting only {@code endsAt} would stretch the transfer instead of pausing it, and the bar
 * would visibly crawl backwards.
 *
 * <p>⚠ It follows that the shift must be applied on <b>every</b> tick and in {@code resume()}, with
 * the same delta the rest of the tick uses. A queue paused across a four-day absence whose clocks
 * were not shifted would find every held transfer finished on the first tick back — the pause
 * silently doing the opposite of what the player asked.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Scope: MARKET downloads only</h2>
 *
 * A file pulled off a machine you are standing on is not queued and never held. That is not an
 * oversight — a purchase is a thing you own that has not arrived yet, and it can wait; a transfer
 * off somebody else's box is running over a session you are holding open and paying for, and
 * putting it behind two bought packages would cost the player a foothold to save them bandwidth
 * they do not have to ration. The two are different acts and the queue governs one of them.
