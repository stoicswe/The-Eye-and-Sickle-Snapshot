 * The rig's capacity ledger — allocate, release, recover, reconcile.

 * <h2>Why this class is fussy about arithmetic</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/01-core-resources.md} §1.4 makes the compute readout mandatory and always
 * visible, and {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.1 goes further: the player must be able to catch a
 * hidden miner by noticing that the numbers <em>do not add up</em>. Both of those depend on the
 * budget reconciling exactly — total = available + allocated + recovering — because a HUD that is
 * routinely off by one teaches the player to ignore discrepancies, which disables the game's central
 * investigation.
 *
 * <p>{@link ComputeBudget} enforces the ceiling itself and refuses over-subscription, so a bug here
 * fails loudly at construction rather than rendering a quietly wrong number. That is deliberate: this
 * is the one readout where being wrong silently is worse than crashing.

     * The allocation ids belonging to parasites no audit has named yet.
     *
     * <h2>Why they are dropped from the snapshot rather than anonymised</h2>
     *
     * A row that said {@code UNKNOWN 6C} would be the readout telling the player they are being
     * robbed, which is exactly the product {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.2 sells audits for. So
     * the row is not published at all, and {@code available} is still computed from the real rig — the
     * cycles are gone, they are simply not attributed.
     *
     * <p>The consequence is deliberate and is the whole mechanic: {@link ComputeBudget#unaccountedFor}
     * becomes non-zero, so <b>claimed + recovering + free comes to less than the rig's ceiling</b>.
     * §3.1 calls noticing that "the game's second-strongest tutorial vector", and it only works if the
     * numbers normally reconcile — which they do, because this is the one thing in the engine that
     * makes them not.
     *
     * <p>⚠ {@code ComputeBudget}'s constructor permits under-reconciliation and rejects
     * over-reconciliation, so dropping rows here is safe by construction and adding phantom ones would
     * not be. That asymmetry is documented there and this is the caller it was written for.
