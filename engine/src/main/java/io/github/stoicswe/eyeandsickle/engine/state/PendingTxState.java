/**
 * One of the player's transactions, waiting for a miner.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The balance has already moved. This is the receipt, not the money.</h2>
 *
 * When a player spends, the ledger is debited and the item is theirs immediately — the same instant a
 * real wallet shows the send and deducts it from your spendable balance. What waits here is the
 * <em>chain record</em>: the transaction a miner has not yet packed into a block.
 *
 * <p>That split is deliberate, and it is the one place this simulation declines to be faithful. A
 * purchase that withheld the goods for fourteen minutes would be accurate and would also make buying
 * a consumable mid-breach impossible, which is a worse game for a lesson the player has already had.
 * What the fee buys here is how soon the transaction is <em>confirmed</em> — visible, checkable, and
 * costing nothing but position in a queue.
