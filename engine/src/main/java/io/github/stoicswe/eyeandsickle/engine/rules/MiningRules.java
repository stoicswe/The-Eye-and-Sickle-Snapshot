/**
 * Income: the safe floor, and the risky ceiling.
 *
 * <h2>The two sources are deliberately asymmetric</h2>
 *
 * <b>Self-mining</b> is the income floor and is protected by two invariants: it generates zero heat
 * and cannot be detected or seized (I4), and it stops a bounded time after the client closes (I5).
 * It is boring on purpose — it is what stops a run from becoming unrecoverable.
 *
 * <p><b>Deployed miners</b> are the <em>volume</em> offline income, and every one of them costs the
 * deployer a permanent control channel while charging its actual work to the <em>host</em> (I6).
 * Their yield accrues into an on-host buffer that stops dead at a cap, so time away is worth
 * something but not proportionally — and the buffer is the prize somebody takes when they crack the
 * miner.
 *
 * <p>⚠ <b>I5 was amended on 2026-07-29 and the two are no longer separated by "offline".</b> The rig
 * keeps hashing for {@code Balance.OFFLINE_MINING_HOURS} after the client closes and then stops dead,
 * so both streams now pay across a bounded absence. What still separates them is <b>exposure and
 * volume</b>: a deployed miner spends somebody else's compute, so five of them buffer five hosts'
 * worth of the same window — and a miner's buffer sits on a machine an attacker can reach, where
 * self-mining cannot be touched. Had the distinction ever rested on "one works offline and one does
 * not", this change would have deleted it. See {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §1.2.
 *
 * <h2>Self-mining is a real proof-of-work simulation since 2026-07-27</h2>
 *
 * It used to be a rate: cycles in, ethecoin out, linearly. It is now a Poisson process against a real
 * difficulty ({@link ChainRules}), read at one of two difficulties:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Pooled</b> — mining against a share target the pool retunes to this rig, paid a fixed
 *       amount per accepted share whether or not the pool found a block. This is pay-per-share, and
 *       the fee is what the pool charges for absorbing the variance. Income is near-constant.
 *   <li><b>Solo</b> — mining against the full network difficulty, paid the whole block subsidy or
 *       nothing at all. Roughly 470× the variance and, because there is no fee, about 2% more in
 *       expectation.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>⚠ <b>Deployed miners are deliberately NOT converted.</b> They are pooled by construction — a
 * buffer that fills at a rate, capped, collected on a visit — and giving them a lottery would put
 * variance on the one income stream the player cannot watch, cannot react to, and collects hours
 * later in a lump anyway. It would also break {@code 04} §5.1's crack timing bet, which is priced on
 * "payout scales with buffer fullness": a buffer that filled in jumps would make "found at minute
 * five, it holds almost nothing" false about half the time. Bots are unchanged for the same reason.

     * bug nobody reports and everybody feels.
     *
     * <p>⚠ This is the <b>flat</b> rate, and it is deliberately still flat. Self-mining moved to a
     * proof-of-work simulation on 2026-07-27; deployed miners did not, for the reasons in this
     * class's comment. The shared constant is not laziness — a deployed miner earns the same
     * 0.4 EC per cycle-hour because {@code docs/design/03-economy.md} §1 prices both against it, and

     * evidence — and here it would be evidence of a bug rather than of an intruder.
     *
     * <p>It has to accrue at all because {@code 04} §5.1 makes the crack a timing bet: "payout scales
     * with buffer fullness. Found at minute five, it holds almost nothing; found at hour four, the
     * full cap. Killing immediately is safe and worth little; leaving it to fatten means bleeding
     * compute meanwhile and risking the deployer returning to collect first." A buffer that never
     * grows makes both branches of that decision worth zero and turns cracking into a formality.
     *
     * <p>The same buffer cap applies, and it is what bounds the prize: four hours of the miner's own
     * host draw, never more, however long the player leaves it.
     *
     * <p>⚠ This must be called on the resume path as well as on tick, for the same reason
     * {@link #accrueDeployedMiners} is: {@code resume()} sets {@code lastTick = now}, so the first
