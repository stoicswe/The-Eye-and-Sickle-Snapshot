/**
 * ⚠ <b>[PROPOSAL]</b> — the player-to-player upgrade market, and the fact that it is not safe.
 *
 * <h2>The mechanic in one line</h2>
 *
 * A sale is <b>not escrowed</b>. The seller takes payment and then chooses whether to send the
 * package. Not sending is a real, available move — which is what makes buying from a stranger a
 * decision rather than a transaction, and what gives {@link #reputation} anything to measure.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ THIS IS A THIRD REPUTATION AND IT MUST NEVER SHARE A FIELD WITH THE OTHER TWO</h2>
 *
 * {@code CLAUDE.md} and {@code docs/design/glossary.md} already warn that <b>factionReputation</b>
 * (standing with the Eye or the Sickle) and <b>validatorReputation</b> (federation trust weighting)
 * are unrelated quantities that must never share a field, a column, a label or a colour. This adds a
 * <b>third</b>: <b>traderReputation</b> — whether you deliver what you were paid for.
 *
 * <p>All three are independent on purpose. A Sickle hero can be a thief; a scrupulous trader can be
 * a validator nobody trusts. Collapsing any two would make one of them a proxy for the other and
 * quietly delete a whole axis of characterisation. The field is {@code GameSave.traderReputation}
 * and nothing else reads or writes it.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Why a decrease is a CHANCE and not a certainty</h2>
 *
 * A guaranteed penalty is just a price, and a price is something a player budgets for. A
 * <em>chance</em> that rises with each undelivered sale cannot be budgeted — the first defection is
 * usually free, the fifth usually is not, and the seller never knows which one will be the one that
 * costs them. That is what makes a reputation worth protecting rather than worth spending.
 *
 * <p>It also matches the fiction: reputation damage comes from a buyer complaining loudly enough to
 * be believed, and whether they are believed is not up to the seller.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing here can fire in single player</h2>
 *
 * Both parties are players. Solo has no counterparty, so a solo character's trader reputation is a
 * permanent zero and no sale is ever pending. The rules exist and are tested now so that the day
 * multiplayer lands (<b>CL-8</b>) this is a transport change and not an engine change — the same
 * argument {@code AccessLog} is written under.
