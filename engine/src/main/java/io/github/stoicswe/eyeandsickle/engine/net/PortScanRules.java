/**
 * Looking at somebody else's machine from outside, and being looked back at.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ This is NOT the audit scan, and the two must not be confused</h2>
 *
 * {@code ScanRules} audits <em>your own rig</em> for parasites: it is inward, silent, and generates
 * no heat, because looking at your own machine is not an act against anybody
 * ({@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.2, Invariant <b>I9</b>). A port scan is the opposite in every
 * one of those respects — it is outward, it touches a machine you do not hold, and it is <b>loud</b>.
 * Sharing a cost ladder between the two would say they were the same kind of act.
 *
 * <h2>The decision this exists to create</h2>
 *
 * A scan that always told you everything would have no decision in it, so depth costs three things at
 * once: <b>cycles</b>, <b>time</b>, and <b>the chance the target notices</b>. Naming what you want to
 * know sets all three ({@link PortScanTarget}), which is why the player picks a question rather than
 * a tier — you are buying an answer and paying for how loudly you had to ask for it.
 *
 * <p>Being noticed is not merely a failed scan. The target gets to respond, and the response is
 * {@code Reprisal}: refuse the scan outright, or come back at you. That is what makes the deepest
 * scan a genuine gamble rather than a strictly-correct default.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Findings are DERIVED from the host, never rolled at scan time</h2>
 *
 * Two scans of the same unchanged machine must agree, or the readout is noise dressed as
 * intelligence — and "was this here before?" is a question this game asks the player to answer
 * constantly. What <em>is</em> rolled is whether you were detected, which is a fact about this
 * attempt rather than about the machine.
