/**
 * One layer of a breach: its budget, its damage, and its board.
 *
 * <h2>Three classes, one class per instance, all three shapes in one file</h2>
 *
 * A layer is an instance of exactly one puzzle class ({@code docs/design/05-hacking-minigame.md}
 * §3.1), so at most one of the three field groups below is populated. That is a union hand-rolled
 * as a flat record rather than a sealed hierarchy, and the reason is the save format: this is a JSON
 * document that outlives the code which wrote it, and polymorphic deserialisation needs a type
 * discriminator that a hand-edited save can get wrong in a way an unused-fields layout cannot. The
 * unused groups serialise as empty lists and zeroes and cost nothing.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Three fields are the answer and must never leave this object</h2>
 *
 * {@link #secret}, {@link #factDeck} and {@link #objectiveNodeId} are the puzzle. {@code
 * BreachSnapshots} does not read them at all — not "filters them", <em>does not read them</em> — so
 * that a hidden field cannot be leaked by a snapshot builder that forgot a branch. A unit test
 * asserts the secret appears nowhere in any snapshot; see {@code BreachSnapshotsTest}.
 *
 * <p>It would be easy to argue this does not matter in a save file the player can edit. It matters
 * because the same records go over a wire to a real home server, where the client is never
 * authoritative (Invariant I14), and because a puzzle whose answer is one careless field copy away
 * from the renderer is not a puzzle anyone can trust.
