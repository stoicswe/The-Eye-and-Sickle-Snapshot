/**
 * The fee market: who gets into the next block, and who waits.
 *
 * <h2>The whole mechanic in three sentences</h2>
 *
 * A block holds {@link Balance#BLOCK_TRANSACTION_LIMIT} transactions. More than that are waiting.
 * Miners take the highest fee rates first, so a fee is a bid for one of a fixed number of slots — and
 * a queue is the only thing that makes a bid mean anything.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The NPC mempool is derived, not stored, and that is not a shortcut</h2>
 *
 * Storing a few hundred synthetic transactions per session would grow the save for a readout that
 * shows a histogram and three projected blocks. Instead the backlog is a function of
 * {@code (blockSeed, height)}: deterministic, so the same chain state always shows the same queue, and
 * free. What <em>is</em> stored is the player's own pending transactions, because those are real state
 * — they paid for them.
 *
 * <p>The backlog drifts with height rather than with the wall clock, deliberately. A mempool that
 * changed while the game was paused would let a player watch the queue for a good moment without the
 * chain advancing, which is a way to game the fee market by doing nothing.

     * The projections used to subtract from a single current backlog: the next block took 200 of

     * A transaction sitting in a mempool is not committed to anything. Its sender can rebroadcast it
     * offering more, and miners — who sort by fee rate — will prefer the new version. Bitcoin calls
     * this RBF, and it is the mechanism behind every "stuck transaction, bump the fee" support thread
     * on the internet. It is worth modelling because it is the piece that makes a fee feel like a
     * <em>bid</em> rather than a price: a player who under-paid, watched their purchase sit three
     * blocks out, and paid the difference to jump the queue has learned what a fee market is in a way
     * no tooltip achieves.
     *
     * <h2>⚠ Only the DIFFERENCE is charged, and that is not a discount</h2>
     *
     * The original fee was already debited when the transaction was broadcast, so charging the full
     * new fee would take it twice. What the player ends up having paid is exactly the new tier's fee,
     * which is what a replacement costs.
     *
     * <p>⚠ Both records are updated. The pending transaction is what {@link #confirmInto} sorts on and
     * what the mempool panel draws; the ledger row is what the block explorer reads once it is mined
     * and the pending record is gone ({@code LedgerEntryState.feeWei}). Updating one would make
     * a boosted transaction sort at the new fee and render at the old one.
     *
     * <h2>⚠ The hash does NOT change</h2>
     *
     * A real replacement is a different transaction with a different txid; this one keeps its hash.
     * That is a deliberate simplification, for the reason {@link #submit} already gives: a hash that
     * changed underneath the player would make the pending row and the mined row two different
     * transactions on a readout {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.1 asks them to reconcile. The
     * simplification is stated in {@code rbf(7)} rather than hidden.

     *
     * A real miner is paid {@code subsidy + fees}, and until 2026-07-27 this game paid only the
     * subsidy — the fees the mempool charged were debited from players and then vanished, which made
     * the fee market a pure sink and contradicted the block card that had been printing a fee total
     * all along. Paying it out is what makes that card mean something.
     *
     * <p>It averages about <b>1690 minor units</b> — roughly 10.6% of the 16 000 subsidy — because a
     * block carries ~105 transactions at a mean fee of ~16. That is a real change to mining income
     * and {@code Balance} absorbs it rather than letting it move the {@code design/03} anchor.
     *
     * <h2>⚠ The total is the derived one, even when the player's own rows are in the block</h2>
     *
     * A player's transaction <em>displaces</em> a piece of network traffic rather than adding to the
     * block, so the count — and therefore this total — does not move when they have something in it.
     * The alternative is a fee total that changes depending on who is looking, and the gain from the
     * displacement is bounded by one transaction's fee against a fee they had to pay to get in. It
     * is not a lever: sending yourself transactions to inflate a block you have a 4% chance of
     * winning costs strictly more than it can return.

     * How many blocks ahead the mempool panel projects — 3 to 5, varying with the chain.

     * <h2>Why it varies at all</h2>
     *
     * A fixed count said something the chain does not: that the queue is always legible exactly three
     * blocks out. How far ahead a mempool can honestly be read depends on how much is in it — a thin
     * queue is predictable further out because there is less traffic to displace what is waiting, and
     * a deep one stops being a projection and starts being a guess after a block or two. Varying the
     * depth is the panel admitting that its horizon is a property of the queue rather than of the
     * panel.
     *
     * <h2>⚠ Derived from chain state, never drawn, and NOT from the wall clock</h2>
     *
     * Three properties, and each one is a bug avoided:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Stable per height.</b> The panel repaints once a second ({@code Views.ledger}'s
     *       {@code refreshClock}). A drawn count would add and remove a card every second, which
     *       reads as the interface glitching rather than as the chain being uncertain.
     *   <li><b>Advances with the chain, not with time.</b> Same rule as {@link #backlog}: a queue
     *       that changed while the chain stood still would let a player watch for a good moment
     *       without paying a block for it.
     *   <li><b>Reproducible.</b> It is a function of {@code (blockSeed, height)}, so the same chain
     *       state always renders the same panel — which is what the whole {@code solo} module's
     *       "pure function of (save, clock)" discipline is for.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The correlation with the backlog is deliberate rather than decorative: the mix is over the
     * same height, so a deep-queue block tends to project shallower and a thin one deeper. It is not
     * a hard rule — that would be a rule players would learn to read the backlog off — but it is the
     * right tendency.
