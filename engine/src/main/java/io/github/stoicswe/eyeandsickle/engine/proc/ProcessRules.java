/**
 * Killing and restarting what is on the process table.
 *
 * <h2>The three verbs and the one price</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Kill a tool of your own.</b> It stops where it is and <em>keeps what it had</em>: a scan
 *       names the parasites it had got to, a sweep reports the machines it had already reached. The
 *       cycles are <b>not</b> refunded and the thermal recovery is the full one for the full amount.
 *       Stopping early buys back your time, never your capacity — which is what stops "start
 *       everything, kill the losers" being free.
 *   <li><b>Kill a parasite.</b> The {@code kill} response from {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §5:
 *       the miner goes, its cycles come back, and its buffer is <b>forfeit</b> — cracking is what
 *       takes the buffer, and a kill that also paid would make the crack pointless. This is the
 *       payoff for a manual audit and the reason the table exists.
 *   <li><b>Restart a daemon.</b> The rig needs it, so it cannot be killed. Restarting takes down
 *       every running tool that depends on it, and each of those is killed by the rule above —
 *       partial results, full recovery. That cost is what makes suspecting a system row a decision
 *       rather than a free click.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Partial results are a truncation of a frozen result, never a re-roll</h2>
 *
 * A scan's finding and a sweep's whole outcome are decided when the work is commissioned and stored
 * on the task, precisely so that quitting cannot change them. Killing early therefore <em>cuts the
 * stored answer down</em> in proportion to how far it got; it does not ask the rules for a new one. A
 * kill that re-rolled would be a reroll a player could force at will, which is the exploit every
 * frozen outcome in this engine exists to close.
 *
 * <h2>Refusals, never exceptions</h2>
 *
 * Same contract as {@code FolderRules}: an empty {@link Outcome} is success and a non-empty one is a
 * sentence the player reads. A rules engine that threw would be deciding how the client reports it.
