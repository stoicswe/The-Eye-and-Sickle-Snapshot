/**
 * What a scan finds, what it gets wrong, and what a Detection Array buys.
 *
 * <h2>Two decisions the design docs made in prose and nothing implemented</h2>
 *
 * <b>Scans can be wrong</b> — {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.2a, decided 2026-07-26, closing
 * DF-5: "A scan result is evidence, not a verdict. Every tier can produce a false positive — a hit
 * on something innocent — and the cheaper tiers do it more often. Signal quality, not just
 * sensitivity, is what a more expensive tier buys."
 *
 * <p><b>The Detection Array buys precision, not sensitivity</b> — {@code
 * docs/design/09-defense-and-hardening.md} §2, decided the same day, closing OQ-6: "it improves the
 * quality of the signal rather than the chance of a hit. Standing compute buys a lower
 * false-positive rate on your own rig, so a Quick Scan on a well-instrumented rig lies to you less
 * often than a Quick Scan on a bare one." The two axes are kept apart here on purpose — {@link
 * #sensitiveTo} does not consult the Array at all, which is what makes the Array non-redundant "by
 * construction rather than by tuning".
 *
 * <h2>Why §3.2a exists at all, and why it must not be softened</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/education/08-detection-and-defence.md} teaches {@code false-positive(7)}, {@code
 * base-rate-fallacy(7)} and {@code alert-fatigue(7)} — three of the curriculum's strongest pages, all
 * resting on the fact that real detectors mostly fire on innocent things. Before §3.2a the scan
 * tiers implied that and never delivered it, so <b>the game contradicted its own manual</b>, which
 * {@code CLAUDE.md} treats as worse than teaching nothing.
 *
 * <p>That is also why a false positive here always names <b>a real, innocent thing on the rig</b>
 * rather than an invented ghost. §3.2a: "a scan hit is now a lead to corroborate against the compute
 * ledger — exactly the cross-referencing §3.1 calls the game's second-strongest tutorial vector —
 * instead of an answer that makes investigation pointless." A player who checks the named process
 * against their own allocation list can rule it out; a player who acts on the headline cannot.
 *
 * <h2>The finding is rolled at scan start, and frozen</h2>
 *
 * {@link TaskState#outcome} has existed since scans became real work and was written by nobody. It
 * is written here, at the moment the scan is commissioned, so that a scan finishing while the game
 * is closed reports what it would have reported in session. Rolling at completion instead would mean
 * a six-minute scan quietly re-rolled its answer depending on whether the player watched — and under
 * the persisted RNG that is also a reroll a player could force by quitting.
