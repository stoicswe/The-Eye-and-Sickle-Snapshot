/**
 * Opening, holding and closing shell sessions on machines.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ A session is not the vantage, and this class never touches the vantage</h2>
 *
 * {@link NetRules#connect} moves the vantage — the single point a sweep measures hop distance from,
 * and a hard ceiling no purchase moves (Invariant <b>I2</b>). Opening a session does not, and nothing
 * here reads or writes {@code vantageAddress}. A player may sit on eight machines and still sweep
 * from exactly one, which is both how remote access actually works and the only arrangement in which
 * reach is not silently multiplied by how many windows are open.
 *
 * <h2>What a session costs, and why it costs anything</h2>
 *
 * {@link Balance#SESSION_CYCLES} while open, charged to {@link ComputeConsumer#SHELL_SESSION}. The
 * point is not the two cycles; it is that "how many machines can I be on at once" gets answered by
 * the rig rather than by a constant in a view. {@code docs/design/00} §4's meta-rule is that compute
 * is the master scarcity, and a free unlimited resource sitting next to it is exactly the kind of
 * thing that quietly stops being a trade-off.
 *
 * <h2>A foothold is required, and the refusal says so</h2>
 *
 * You cannot open a shell on a machine you have not broken into — that is what breaking in is
 * <em>for</em> ({@code docs/design/05}). The player's own rig is always available and is not a
 * foothold. Refusals come back empty with a reason the caller words, matching every other rule in
 * this engine: a rules class that threw on an unaffordable action would be deciding how the client
 * reports it.
