/**
 * Everything running on the rig, as rows — the manual audit {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.1
 * has always described and nothing ever implemented.
 *
 * <h2>Four sources, one shape</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>System processes</b> ({@link SystemProcesses}) — FreeBSD's kernel threads and daemons plus
 *       the fiction's own. The haystack, and what a mimic hides among.
 *   <li><b>The player's own work</b> — running tasks, self-mining, armed defences, held tool
 *       allocations. Everything here is something they started and can therefore stop.
 *   <li><b>Parasites</b> — in whatever costume {@link Disguise} put them in. ⚠ They come out of this
 *       method looking exactly like the rows above them; nothing in {@link RigProcess} says which is
 *       which.
 *   <li><b>Nothing else.</b> There is no filler. Every row corresponds to something the engine
 *       genuinely models, which is what lets the table be cross-checked against the compute grid.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>⚠ An undiscovered parasite is listed here and nowhere else</h2>
 *
 * It is absent from the compute ledger by design ({@code ComputeRules.snapshot}), so the grid comes
 * up short and says nothing. This table is the one place it is visible <em>at all</em> — wearing a
 * costume, among three dozen honest rows. The grid tells you something is wrong; this is where you go
 * to find out what.
 *
 * <h2>The figures move like a machine's, on a five-second tick</h2>
 *
 * {@link Vitals} does the arithmetic and its class note has the reasoning. In short: <b>gauges
 * wander</b> around a resting level rather than teleporting, <b>counters only ever increase</b>, and
 * everything is a pure function of {@code (identity, interval)} — so two reads inside the same tick
 * are identical, a player can compare two rows without racing them, and nothing here touches the
 * persisted {@code Rng}.
 *
 * <p>That movement is not decoration. Two of the five disguises are caught by comparing figures — one
 * row against another, or one row against itself a few ticks later — and both require the numbers to
 * be honest enough to compare.
