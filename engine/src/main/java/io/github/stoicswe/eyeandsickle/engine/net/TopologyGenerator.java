/**
 * Builds the world once, from the save's seed, and never again.
 *
 * <h2>Shape: a depth-biased spanning tree over 5–7 servers, plus at most two depth-preserving chords</h2>
 *
 * The alternatives were considered and each fails for a specific reason. A <b>chain</b> gives one
 * path and no choice; depth is forced rather than chosen, and a single unlucky bridge placement
 * soft-locks the run. A <b>ring</b> makes depth from home ambiguous — two directions — and a seven-ring
 * caps depth at three, so the "deeper is more dangerous" gradient has nowhere to go. A <b>full mesh or
 * Erdős–Rényi graph</b> makes connectivity probabilistic, which turns "no server is unreachable" into a
 * retry loop instead of a construction. A <b>tree plus chords</b> gives connectivity by construction —
 * every server attaches to one already placed — an unambiguous depth, real branching so the player
 * chooses which way to push, and enough extra edges that the result reads as a network rather than a
 * taxonomy.
 *
 * <p>⚠ <b>The chord depth rule is load-bearing.</b> A chord between servers at depths {@code d} and
 * {@code d+2} would shorten a BFS path and silently re-depth a server <em>after</em> its machines had
 * already been generated against the old depth — a whole server one tier too hard or too soft, with
 * nothing in the save to show it. Constraining chords to {@code |d(a) − d(b)| ≤ 1} makes BFS depth
 * provably invariant under chord addition, and {@code TopologyGeneratorTest} checks that over ten
 * thousand seeds rather than trusting the argument.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The RNG contract: draw unconditionally, discard conditionally</h2>
 *
 * Every loop below draws a fixed number of values per iteration, whether or not the values are used.
 * A conditional draw makes the stream's <em>shape</em> depend on the code path, and a replay from a
 * stored seed then depends on the code as well as the seed — which is the one thing {@code Rng} exists
 * to guarantee. So a host that is structurally a {@code GATEWAY} still rolls a kind and discards it;
 * the chord pass draws for every unordered pair including adjacent ones; and step 4 spends one draw on
 * nothing at all, reserving a slot so a future per-server property can be added without shifting every
 * downstream host's stream. <b>Do not remove the padding draw.</b>
 *
 * <p>The total number of draws is therefore a pure function of {@code (nServers, hostCounts,
 * edgeCount)}, each itself determined by earlier draws — so a fixed seed produces a byte-identical
 * world, and {@code save.rngSeed} after generation is a fixed known value. Both are tested.
 *
 * <h2>Detection is decided here, once</h2>
 *
 * {@link HostState#detectRoll} is drawn during generation and never re-drawn. A sweep compares it
 * against a threshold; it never rolls. That is what makes re-sweeping useless and save-scumming
 * pointless <em>by construction</em> rather than by cooldown — see {@code NetRules} §the sweep, and
 * {@code Rng}'s own javadoc for the same argument one level down.
 *
 * <h2>The home floor is a guarantee, not a tuning</h2>
 *
 * Step 8 runs after every roll and takes no draws. It is the fix for "discovery is unusable at the
 * start": whatever the seed did, the player's rig ends up with at least five neighbours, at least
 * three of which are tier-1, un-firewalled, undefended machines with {@code detectRoll = 0.0} — below
 * the base sweep's worst threshold — and a payout floor. The first sweep a new character runs always
 * returns at least three workable targets. Always, on every seed.

     * <h2>⚠ WHAT THIS REPLACED, and why the old shape was a defect rather than a simplification</h2>
     *
     * Every host used to attach to a uniformly chosen already-placed host — a <b>random recursive
     * tree</b>. That is connected by construction, costs one draw per host, and produces a shape
     * <em>nobody chose</em>: expected depth about {@code log(count)}, and a branch factor that is
     * whatever the uniform parent choice happens to give. {@code docs/client/09} §8 measured the
     * consequence over seven generated worlds and filed it: <b>"layers are 1–5 machines wide, maps
     * are 4–10 columns deep… fan-out does not occur at reachable depth"</b>. The map's stack fold was
     * built for a fan-out the generator was never going to produce.
     *
     * <h2>The construction — {@code docs/design/18-network-topology.md} §2</h2>
     *
     * <ol>
     *   <li>A <b>spine</b> of {@code depth} machines from the gateway, which is what makes the depth
     *       exact rather than emergent.
     *   <li>Every remaining machine hangs off an already-placed host that still has room and is not
     *       already at the depth limit.
     *   <li>The first two surplus machines are forced onto <b>two different</b> spine hosts, so
     *       {@code NET_MIN_BRANCHING_NODES} is a guarantee rather than a probability.
     * </ol>
     *
     * <h2>⚠ EXACTLY {@code n − 1} DRAWS, one per host after the gateway, unconditionally</h2>
     *
     * The same count the random recursive tree took, so nothing downstream in the stream moves. A
     * spine host consumes its draw and discards it — its parent is structural — which is this
     * generator's standing "draw unconditionally, discard conditionally" rule and the reason a replay
     * from a stored seed depends on the seed rather than on the code path.
     *
     * <h2>⚠ Branch capacity is HASHED, not drawn, for the same reason</h2>
     *
     * A per-host width draw would be a second value per host and would shift every host's property
     * block downstream of it — re-rolling every existing world. {@code AddressHash} is fixed before
     * the player arrives and cannot give two answers, which is the property the whole discovery
     * system already rests on.
