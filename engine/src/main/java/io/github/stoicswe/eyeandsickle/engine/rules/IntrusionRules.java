/**
 * Somebody else getting onto the player's rig — the one implementation, for every way it can happen.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is its own class</h2>
 *
 * Being counter-hacked has two causes now: a <b>sweep</b> that reached machines which noticed
 * ({@code NetRules}), and a <b>loud breach</b> that got answered ({@code BreachRules}). Those live in
 * two packages that must not depend on each other, and the planting itself is neither a network rule
 * nor a puzzle rule — it is a fact about the rig. Duplicating it would be worse than the coupling: a
 * parasite planted by one path and not dressed, or not charged heat, or not given an allocation,
 * would be a second class of parasite that behaves differently from the first and nobody would notice
 * until a player found one that could not be audited.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ What the caller still owns</h2>
 *
 * The <b>roll</b>. This plants; it never decides whether to. Sweeps roll at commission and freeze the
 * answer ({@code NetRules.beginSweep}); a breach rolls at resolution against the noise it made. Both
 * of those are decisions about <em>that</em> mechanic's fairness, and moving them here would put two
 * unrelated tuning knobs in a class that should have none.

     * <p>⚠ <b>The heat lands on the player, and Invariant I9 is not violated.</b> The player reached
     * another machine, which is an intrusive outbound action and heat-bearing under
     * {@code docs/design/01-core-resources.md} §3. What I9 protects is the <em>next</em> step: the
     * crack of the planted miner runs on the player's own rig and generates no heat on any outcome
     * ({@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §5.1). So being counter-hacked is not only a punishment — it
     * hands the player the safest teaching target in the game, on the already-built crack path.
     *
     * <p>The miner holds a real {@code DEPLOYED_MINER} allocation, which is what makes it findable by
     * the audit in §3.1: the cycle totals genuinely stop adding up. A rig too full to reserve gets the
     * miner <em>without</em> the allocation rather than no miner at all — the same fallback
     * {@code Targets.plantTutorialMiner} takes, because a parasite that declined to install because
     * the machine was busy would be the wrong lesson entirely.
     *
     * @param depth how deep the provocation was; sets the miner's tier, its appetite, whether it is
     *     rootkit-wrapped, and the heat
     * @param now the session clock. ⚠ Never {@code Instant.now()} — {@code deployedAt} and
     *     {@code lastAccruedAt} both default to it, and leaving them there dates a fresh parasite to
     *     the real world's present however the caller's clock is set
     * @return the planted miner, so the caller can name it in a log line
