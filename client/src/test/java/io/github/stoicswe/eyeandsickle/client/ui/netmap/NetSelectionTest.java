/**
 * The machine the player has picked is unmistakable on the graph, and costs the picture nothing.
 *
 * <h2>Why "costs nothing" is asserted as hard as "is visible"</h2>
 *
 * The map is a character-cell texture whose every column is a fixed width, and the two obvious ways
 * to mark a cell — prepend a marker, or widen the frame — both shear everything to their right. The
 * marks chosen here are a one-for-one character swap (the frame) and a replacement of a blank the
 * address line already had (the bar), so the grid is byte-for-byte the same size selected or
 * not. That is the property worth a test; "did it get brighter" is a stylesheet question.
