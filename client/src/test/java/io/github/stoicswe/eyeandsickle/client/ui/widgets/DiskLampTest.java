/**

 * <p>⚠ This exists because the thing it checks is <b>invisible to inspection</b>. The lamp flickers
 * for two seconds after a write and then settles, which no screenshot will catch and no amount of
 * staring at the deck will confirm tick by tick. Everything below is behaviour a real drive LED has
 * and that a three-line version of this widget would get subtly wrong.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here starts a toolkit: {@link Flicker} is a value and the pattern is a constant, which
 * is the entire reason the state machine was pulled out of the widget.
