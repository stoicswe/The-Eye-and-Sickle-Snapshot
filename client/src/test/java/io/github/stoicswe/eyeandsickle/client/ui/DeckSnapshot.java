 * Renders the deck to a PNG, without opening a window.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 *
 * A stylesheet can compile, load and apply cleanly while producing a screen nobody would ship. The
 * checks in {@code UiContractTest} catch rule violations in the source; they cannot catch a panel
 * that lays out three pixels wide, a font that silently fell back, or a palette overlay loaded in
 * the wrong order. This renders the real scene graph with the real stylesheets and writes the
 * result, so those are visible.
 *
 * <p>{@link Scene#snapshot} rather than a screen capture: it needs no display server, captures only
 * the application, and cannot accidentally photograph whatever else is on the machine. It is also
 * the only approach that works in CI.
 *
 * <p>Test scope on purpose — this is a verification tool, not a product feature, and a
 * snapshot-to-file hook wired into the shipped client would be a file-write path that exists for
 * nobody's benefit but a developer's.
