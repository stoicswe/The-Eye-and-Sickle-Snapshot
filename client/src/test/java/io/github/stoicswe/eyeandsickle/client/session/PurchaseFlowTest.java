 * Buying a tool: pay, download, wait for the block, install.
 *
 * <h2>What changed on 2026-07-29</h2>
 *
 * A purchase used to hand over the item in the same call that took the money — a decision
 * {@code GameEngine.debit} defended in as many words as "the one place this simulation declines to be
 * faithful". It now goes over the same pipeline a stolen upgrade does: a real transfer bounded by the
 * vendor's uplink, a package in {@code ~/Downloads}, and an {@code install} step.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The `.pkg` → `.upg` rename IS the lock, and there is no second mechanism</h2>
 *
 * {@code Repac} already draws the line between "a vendor's package" and "one this rig can install",
 * and a bought package simply does not cross it until the payment is mined. That means the lock is
 * visible in {@code ls}, in the file manager and in the shell without any of them being told about
 * confirmation — and it means there is no flag anywhere that can disagree with the chain.
