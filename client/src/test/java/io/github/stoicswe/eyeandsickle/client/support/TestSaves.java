/**
 * Characters for tests that are not about the tutorial.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 *
 * {@code GameEngine.newCharacter} plants a foreign miner on every new rig. That is deliberate —
 * {@code docs/design/04} §5.1 makes cracking one the tutorial for the whole breach system, and
 * without it a fresh character has no reachable breach target at all, which would leave the game's
 * central pillar unreachable until the player discovers a node.
 *
 * <p>By <b>Invariant I6</b> a deployed miner spends the <em>host's</em> compute, so a brand-new rig
 * genuinely has {@code 100 - Balance.TUTORIAL_MINER_HOST_CYCLES} cycles free rather than 100. That
 * is the invariant working, not a bug — and it is also the thing that makes
 * {@code docs/design/04} §3.1's audit mechanic true on day one, because the ledger stops adding up
 * and there is finally a discrepancy to notice.
 *
 * <p>⚠ Most tests in this module are about something else entirely — exit statuses, shortcut
 * parity, an income projection — and they assert against a rig's free capacity as a convenient
 * constant. Rewriting each of those to {@code 100 - 6} would bury the thing under test beneath an
 * unrelated number and would have to be redone the day the tutorial's cost changes. Removing the
 * parasite keeps every assertion saying what it was written to say.
 *
 * <p>Tests that ARE about the tutorial must call {@link GameEngine#open} directly and assert on the
 * parasite — see {@code GameEngineTest.Breach} in the solo module.

     * <h2>⚠ A starting rig is 24 cycles as of 2026-08-06 and these tests were written against 100</h2>
     *
     * Exactly the same argument as removing the parasite, one number along. Most tests in this
     * module are about something else entirely — an exit status, a shortcut, an income projection —
     * and they allocate 40 or 80 cycles as a convenient constant. Against a 24-cycle rig every one
     * of those allocations is <b>refused</b>, the rig silently does nothing, and the failure surfaces
     * somewhere unrelated: a rate assertion, a task that was never created, a log line that never
     * appeared. Giving the fixture the rig its subject needs keeps each assertion saying what it was
     * written to say.
     *
     * <p>⚠ Grants the ITEMS rather than writing {@code totalCycles}. The ceiling is derived from what
     * the rig holds, and a written one is stomped by the next {@code reconcile} — which is the
     * anti-cheat property that derivation exists for. A fixture that fought it would work until the
     * first tick.
     *
     * <p>Tests that ARE about the ladder must build their own rig — see
     * {@code ComputeLadderTest} in the engine module.
