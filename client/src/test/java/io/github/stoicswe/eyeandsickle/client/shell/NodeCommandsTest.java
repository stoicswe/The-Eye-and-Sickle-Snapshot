/**
 * The commands that run on a machine.
 *
 * <h2>The two properties worth pinning</h2>
 *
 * <b>The catalogue is the menu is the parser.</b> {@link NodeCommands#catalogue()} supplies the
 * right-click menu's entries, the options it offers, and the flags {@link NodeCommands#run} reads. If
 * those ever came apart, the menu would insert flags the parser ignores — silently, because an
 * ignored flag produces output that looks fine.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here decides readability.</b> Every listing comes from the port and carries the
 * rules' own {@code readable} verdict (I14). The tests below check the commands render that verdict
 * rather than computing one.
