/**
 * Right-clicking a machine on the map.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The bug this exists for, and why it was invisible until it shipped</h2>
 *
 * The handler selected the machine before showing the menu — correctly, so that the entries are about
 * the thing under the pointer rather than whatever was selected before. But selecting repaints, and
 * repainting <b>rebuilds the graph</b>, so the label the player right-clicked is detached from the
 * scene by the time the popup is anchored to it. JavaFX then throws
 * {@code "The owner node needs to be associated with a window"} — from the FX thread, on every
 * right-click of a node.
 *
 * <p>Nothing in the type system or in a render catches it: the code compiles, the menu is built
 * correctly, and a snapshot never right-clicks anything. The fix anchors the popup to the
 * <b>window</b>, captured before the repaint, and screen coordinates make that identical on screen.
 *
 * <p>⚠ A scene with no {@code Window} reproduces the same condition a detached node does, which is
 * what makes this testable headlessly: the unfixed code throws here for exactly the reason it threw
 * in the running client.

     * Starts the JavaFX toolkit, or <b>skips this class</b> when there is no display.
     *
     * <h2>⚠ This is the only JUnit test in the repo that starts the toolkit, and it broke CI</h2>
     *
     * Every other file here that touches JavaFX is a {@code *Snapshot} <b>main class</b>, run by hand.
     * That is the repo's convention and this test is the exception to it, so it is the one that has to
     * cope with a headless runner: GitHub Actions' Linux image has no {@code DISPLAY}, and
     * {@code Platform.startup} there throws {@code UnsupportedOperationException: Unable to open
     * DISPLAY} — which failed the whole build rather than this one test.
     *
     * <p>⚠ <b>Aborted, not caught and passed.</b> {@code Assumptions.abort} marks the class
     * <em>skipped</em>, so CI reports honestly that this guard did not run. Swallowing the failure and
     * returning green would be the worst outcome available: a regression test that reports success
     * without executing is exactly the failure this class's own comment warns about, one level up.
     *
     * <p>It still runs on any developer machine, which is where the bug it guards was found and where
     * a rendering change is made. Making it run in CI needs {@code xvfb-run} on the Linux job or the
     * Monocle headless platform on the test classpath; neither is wired up, and both are a bigger
     * decision than this test.
