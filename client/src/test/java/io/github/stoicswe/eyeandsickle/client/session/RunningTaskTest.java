/**
 * The rig's running-task readout.
 *
 * <h2>What this is really guarding</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.2 publishes a Duration column beside every scan tier — ~30s,
 * ~2 min, ~6 min — and for most of this project's life nothing waited for it: {@code scan()} spent
 * the cycles and returned, so a Thorough Scan was instantaneous and the published figure was
 * decoration. These tests exist so it cannot quietly become decoration again.
 *
 * <p>{@link Progress#progressUsesTheEngineClock()} is the one that caught a real bug. It is worth
 * keeping even though it looks trivial.
