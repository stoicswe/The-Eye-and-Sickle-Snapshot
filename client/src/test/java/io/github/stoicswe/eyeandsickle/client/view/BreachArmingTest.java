/**
 * Arming, and the notification that makes it visible.
 *
 * <h2>The bug this is the regression test for</h2>
 *
 * The breach window subscribed to the <em>session</em> and to nothing else. Arming is not game state
 * — it is an intention the player has not acted on — so it does not travel through the session, and
 * picking a different row in the target list therefore changed the armed id and <b>repainted
 * nothing</b>: the launch panel kept naming the previous target and the row highlight never moved.
 * The list looked broken because the only thing listening for a change was the one thing that could
 * not hear about this one.
 *
 * <p>{@code BreachArming} carries no JavaFX, so the fan-out is assertable headlessly. What is not
 * assertable here is that {@code BreachView} actually subscribes; that is one line, and this class
 * exists so the line has something to be wrong against.
