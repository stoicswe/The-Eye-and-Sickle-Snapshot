/**
 * The bezel amendment's conditions, as tests rather than as prose.
 *
 * <p>{@code ui-design-language.md} §9 cut bezel twice and §9.1 pointedly kept it cut when four other
 * screen artefacts were permitted. It is allowed since 2026-07-27 on explicit direction, under
 * §9.1's same four conditions — and the two that can be checked mechanically are checked here,
 * because an amendment defended only by a paragraph erodes.
