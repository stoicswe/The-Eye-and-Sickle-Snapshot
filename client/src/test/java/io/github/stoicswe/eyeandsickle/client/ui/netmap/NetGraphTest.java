/**
 * What the map actually draws.
 *
 * <h2>Why this reads {@link NetCanvas} rather than building a {@link NetGraph}</h2>
 *
 * ⚠ Measured on this project, JavaFX 26.0.2 / JDK 26: {@code new VBox()} succeeds with no toolkit and
 * {@code new Label("x")} does <b>not</b> — {@code ExceptionInInitializerError} caused by
 * {@code IllegalStateException: Toolkit not initialized}, thrown from {@code Control}'s static
 * initialiser before any constructor body runs. {@code Tooltip} fails identically. The client bundles
 * neither TestFX nor Monocle, and {@code UiContractTest} is explicit that "a contract test that only
 * runs on a machine with a display is a contract test that does not run in CI".
 *
 * <p>So the picture is computed by a class with no JavaFX supertype, and {@code NetGraph.frame()}
 * returns exactly {@code NetCanvas.frame(...)} for the same map and phase. Asserting on the latter
 * asserts on the former, character for character — and it runs everywhere.
 *
 * <h2>What is worth asserting on a character grid</h2>
 *
 * Every check below is a failure this kind of renderer actually produces. Edges that erase each other
 * instead of merging; a lane routed straight through a node cell, silently replacing a block glyph
 * with a stub; an animation frame that lands on a junction and deletes a branch from the map the
 * player is deducing on. All three look like a perfectly reasonable picture in a screenshot.
