/**
 * The one thing a close handler needs and could not have: the size the window was.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The bug this exists for, and why the code that had it looked right</h2>
 *
 * {@code DeckShell.rememberSize} recorded a closing window's size by looking the window up in
 * {@code desk.windows()}. Its own comment said the read happened <em>"at the moment the geometry
 * still exists"</em>. It did not: {@link DeskManager#close} removes the window from its map
 * <b>before</b> invoking {@code onClosed}, deliberately and with its own comment explaining why —
 * the shell's callback ends the session, which closes the window again, and firing before the
 * removal would recurse.
 *
 * <p>So the lookup found nothing, {@code ifPresent} did nothing, and <b>a window closed by hand
 * never recorded its size</b>. Every resize a player made was thrown away by the one action most
 * likely to follow it. The only reason {@code windowSizes} was ever populated at all is
 * {@code saveLayout}, which covers windows that were still OPEN at quit — the other case entirely.
 *
 * <p>⚠ Two comments, both correct in isolation, describing incompatible orderings — which is the
 * same failure shape as {@code NetRules.reconcileFootholds} and {@code Spec.onClosed} itself, both
 * of which this repo has already recorded. A unit test on either side sees nothing wrong.
 *
 * <p>The fix is to stop making the callback ask: {@code onClosed} is handed the geometry the window
 * had, because the only party that can still see it is the one doing the removal.
