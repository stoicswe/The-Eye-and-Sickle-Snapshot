/**
 * The resize grip.
 *
 * <h2>Why this has its own test</h2>
 *
 * The grip shipped broken once. {@link DeskManager} reads the pointer position inside a JavaFX
 * <em>event filter</em>, and in a filter {@code MouseEvent.getX()} is relative to the event's target
 * node rather than to the node the filter is installed on. Since the target is nearly always some
 * label or scroll pane inside the tool, the raw coordinates were that child's — so the grip worked
 * on an empty panel and stopped working wherever a tool had put content, which is everywhere.
 *
 * <p>The fix is a {@code sceneToLocal} conversion at the call site; this test covers the arithmetic
 * that conversion feeds. It is deliberately pure — no toolkit, no Stage — because a grip test that
 * only runs on a machine with a display would not have caught the original bug either.
