/**
 * What actually reaches the bus when the game is played.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is separate from {@link EventBusTest}</h2>
 *
 * That one proves the broker works. This one proves it is <b>wired to the things that happen</b>,
 * which is the requirement that can rot: a chokepoint someone reroutes, a background settle that
 * moves into a branch nothing publishes from. A missing event looks exactly like an interaction that
 * never occurred, so the only way to know the stream is complete is to make the game do something and
 * assert the event arrived.
