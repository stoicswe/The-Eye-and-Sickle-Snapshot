/**
 * Every palette is legible, measured rather than assumed.
 *
 * <h2>What this is, and what it is deliberately NOT</h2>
 *
 * The obvious way to guarantee readable text is a runtime layer that inspects the theme and adjusts
 * colours until they pass. This is not that, and the reason is the design language rather than
 * effort: {@code ui-design-language.md} §10 criterion 2 requires every colour to be a looked-up token
 * declared in a stylesheet, and {@code CLAUDE.md} puts it plainly — <b>colours live in
 * {@code theme.css} and nowhere else</b>. A layer that computed a colour at run time would make the
 * rendered palette unpredictable, unreviewable, and impossible to state in a document; it would also
 * quietly overrule the deliberate choices each theme makes, which is the opposite of preserving them.
 *
 * <p>So the guarantee is enforced <b>at build time, against each theme's own colours</b>. Nothing here
 * invents a value. It computes the real WCAG contrast ratio for each pair the interface actually
 * draws and fails the build when a theme's own palette cannot carry its own text — which puts the fix
 * where it belongs, in the stylesheet, chosen by a person.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ What this caught</h2>
 *
 * {@code -es-dim-3} is the <b>greeble</b> colour — decorative texture — and the network map was using
 * it for the CONTACT and LOCKED node states. Measured: <b>1.77:1</b> on the deck palette and
 * <b>2.06:1</b> on uOS Classic, whose light ramp made those nodes vanish outright. A state a player
 * has to read is not "quiet" at 1.8:1, it is missing. Also found: the deck's own {@code -es-dim-2} at
 * 2.78:1, the single token in that palette under the floor, carrying server and layer labels.

     * ⚠ §9.4 condition 2, and the one bound a glass palette can actually breach.
     *
     * <h2>What goes wrong, and why nothing else here would catch it</h2>
     *
     * JavaFX has no backdrop filter, so a translucent panel does not blur what is behind it — it
     * shows it, sharp. Desk windows overlap. So a panel whose alpha is tuned by eye on a bare desk
     * (where the only thing behind is the wallpaper, and it looks wonderful) turns into two columns
     * of interleaved monospace the moment the player drags a second window under the first. Every
     * other assertion in this class passes throughout: the panel's own text is still perfectly
     * legible against the panel. The damage is done by content that is not the panel's at all.
     *
     * <h2>⚠ The bound was WEAKENED on 2026-08-05, deliberately, and this records what was given up</h2>
     *
     * It was <b>"no more legible than greeble"</b> — {@code -es-dim-3}, the design language's own name
     * for texture deliberately below the threshold of being read. That is the stronger claim and it is
     * the one to restore if the direction ever changes; it caps transmission at around 5%.
     *
     * <p>uOS Modern Liquid Abs was then directed to be <em>very</em> transparent glass, which is
     * incompatible with it: the palettes now transmit 40–60%, and at that level a window behind is
     * unmistakably present. So the guarantee is now the weaker but still meaningful one — <b>what
     * shows through must stay below {@link #FLOOR}</b>, the ratio at which this client considers a
     * thing legible at all. Above it a second screen is readable under every overlapping window;
     * below it there is visibly something there and it cannot be read as text.
     *
     * <p><b>What that costs, stated plainly:</b> the backdrop is no longer merely a material. A player
     * who overlaps two windows will see shapes moving under the top one. That is the trade the
     * transparency buys, it was made on explicit direction, and it is the reason the light film in
     * {@code theme-liquid-dark.css} matters so much — a light film compresses a dark backdrop's range
     * hard, which is what keeps the ghost under the floor at all, where a mid-toned film at the same
     * alpha measures 4.95:1 and is plainly readable.
     *
     * <h2>⚠ THIS BOUND IS NECESSARY AND NOT SUFFICIENT — the palettes are tuned BELOW it</h2>
     *
     * A build that measured <b>2.78:1</b> here, comfortably passing, rendered the notification stack
     * over the LOG window as two columns of text in the same pixels. Each was individually below the
     * legibility floor and the pair was unreadable, because <b>this is a per-pair luminance ratio and
     * cannot see two texts competing for the same glyph cells.</b> The shipped transmission is set by
     * rendering, not by this number, and it sits well under the line.
     *
     * <p>The other half of that fix is {@code -es-float}: a window may be glass because what is behind
     * it is usually the desk, but a toast, dialog, menu or tooltip is <em>always</em> over content and
     * is therefore opaque in these palettes. <b>Passing this test does not mean a palette is
     * legible — render it.</b>
     *
     * <p>The worst case is measured, not a sample: the brightest text this palette draws, on the
     * raised surface, seen through the panel.
