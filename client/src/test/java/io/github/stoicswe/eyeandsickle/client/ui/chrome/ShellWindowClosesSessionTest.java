/**
 * Closing a shell window hands its cycles back.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The bug this exists for, and why every existing test passed while it shipped</h2>
 *
 * A shell holds {@link Balance#SESSION_CYCLES} for as long as it is open. Two things can end one and
 * only one of them worked:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Typing {@code exit} — the shell view asks the rules to close the session, then asks the desk
 *       to close the window. Cycles released. ✓
 *   <li>Clicking the window's {@code [×]} — straight to the window manager. The frame vanished and
 *       <b>the allocation stayed reserved</b>, with nothing left on screen to release it. The rig
 *       monitor showed compute held by a shell the player could not see, and only a restart cleared
 *       it. ✗
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@code DeskManager.Spec} accepted an {@code onClosed} callback and dropped it: it was declared,
 * passed in by {@code DeckShell.showShell}, and never invoked. Both halves looked right in isolation
 * — {@code SessionRulesTest} proves the rules release correctly, and the window manager closes
 * windows correctly — and the defect lived in the join, which is precisely where a unit test on
 * either side cannot look. Same failure shape as {@code NetRules.reconcileFootholds}, which was
 * written, documented, tested, and called by nothing.
 *
 * <p>⚠ This test is therefore written at the level the bug is visible: a real session, a real desk,
 * and the compute budget checked before and after a <b>window</b> close.

     * <p>⚠ <b>Aborted, not caught and passed.</b> A regression test reporting success without
     * executing is worse than none. It runs on any developer machine — which is where this bug was
     * found and where a window-manager change is made. ⚠ It therefore guards nothing in CI until
     * {@code xvfb-run} or Monocle is wired up; that gap is recorded in {@code CLAUDE.md} and is not
     * this test's to close.
