/**
 * Renders the LEDGER window's three tabs, and the {@code SYNCHRONIZING} panel, to PNGs.
 *
 * <h2>Why the ledger gets a snapshot of its own</h2>
 *
 * {@link DeckSnapshot} opens four windows at desk size and proves the deck lays out. It cannot prove
 * anything about this window, because the three things added on 2026-07-29 are exactly the three
 * kinds of thing a text assertion cannot see: a <b>ten-column table</b> whose headers only fit if the
 * preferred widths sum to less than the panel, a <b>discrete meter</b> replaying a fill, and a
 * <b>summary block</b> whose lines are chosen by branches most loads do not take.
 *
 * <p>It also needs a save that is not a fresh character. The interesting states here — a chain that
 * ran for eight hours without the client, a contributor history with both paid and unpaid rows —
 * only exist after a session has been played and closed, so this builds one rather than snapshotting
 * the empty case and calling it verified.
 *
