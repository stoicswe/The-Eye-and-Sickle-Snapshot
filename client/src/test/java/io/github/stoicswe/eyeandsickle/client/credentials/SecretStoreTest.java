 * <b>A secret must never appear in a process's argument list.</b> Arguments are world-readable —
 * {@code ps} shows them to every user on the machine — and macOS's own {@code security} tool says so
 * in its usage text. The failure is invisible: the credential stores correctly, the feature works,
 * and the password is on the process table the whole time. {@link NeverInArgv} is that property, and
 * it is worth more than every other test in this file.
 *
 * <h2>Why most of this is source inspection rather than round trips</h2>
 *
 * A real round trip writes to the developer's own keychain, can raise an OS prompt, and only ever
 * exercises one of three platforms. {@link Roundtrip} does it anyway — because the alternative is
 * trusting a command shape nobody has ever run — but it is <b>opt-in and skipped by default</b>. See
 * that class for why and for how to run it.

     * Every other test in this file is inert — it reads source, or builds a command list and looks at
     * it. These are the only ones with a <b>side effect on the developer's own machine</b>, and that
     * is a different kind of test:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>They write to a real keychain.</b> A throwaway item, deleted in a {@code finally} —
     *       but a failure between the store and the cleanup leaves a credential-shaped entry behind
     *       in somebody's personal keychain, which no unit test should be able to do as a side effect
     *       of {@code mvn verify}.
     *   <li><b>They can raise an OS prompt.</b> These tools <em>ask</em> when they cannot proceed — a
     *       locked keychain, a missing agent — and a prompt in a build is a build that appears to
     *       hang. {@code ToolRunner} bounds it at ten seconds, so the honest outcome is a slow,
     *       confusing failure rather than a hang, and neither belongs in the default loop.
     *   <li><b>They are platform-specific by construction.</b> Whichever machine runs them, at most
     *       one store is exercised and the rest report as skipped — so a green run here never meant
     *       what it looked like it meant.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h2>⚠ THE GATE IS ON THE CLASS, NOT ON EACH METHOD, and that is deliberate</h2>
     *
     * A Windows or Secret Service round trip is worth adding one day — {@code CLAUDE.md} records that
     * both are currently <b>unverified on real hardware</b>. Gating the enclosing class means such a
     * test is opt-in <em>by being written here</em>, rather than by somebody remembering to repeat an
     * annotation. The per-store {@code available()} assumptions stay underneath as well: opting in on
     * Linux must still not try to run {@code /usr/bin/security}.
     *
     * <h2>⚠ THEY ARE KEPT, NOT DELETED, AND THAT IS THE POINT</h2>
     *
     * Running this exact code is what found the two things nothing else could: {@code security}
     * prompts for the password <b>twice</b> and sending it once fails while <b>still exiting zero</b>,
     * and {@code -U} is required or a changed app password silently keeps the old secret. Neither is
     * visible from the command list, so deleting these would delete the only check that the shape
     * this file so carefully verifies actually <em>works</em>.
