/**
 * A panel that drops out from under a cell in the top strip.
 *
 * <h2>What it is for</h2>
 *
 * The chain runs while the client does not, so a load has a report to make — and that report used to
 * live at the top of the LEDGER window's CHAIN tab, where a player had to go and look for it. The
 * thing it is about is the <b>balance</b>, which is on screen at all times, so this hangs the report
 * off the balance cell instead: the number that changed, and immediately under it the account of why.
 *
 * <p>It is deliberately not a {@code Notifications} toast. A toast is a line of text that expires;
 * this is a panel with a meter and a multi-line summary, it is the only one of its kind in a session,
 * and it is <em>about</em> a specific readout rather than about the rig in general. Reusing the toast
 * stack would have put it in a queue behind whatever else the load logged, which is exactly where it
 * would be missed.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ It emerges from BEHIND the strip, which is what the clip is for</h2>
 *
 * This layer sits above {@code deckRoot} in the deck's {@link StackPane}, so it paints over the top
 * strip rather than under it. Sliding a panel down from {@code translateY = -height} would therefore
 * draw it <em>on top of</em> the strip on the way past — a panel crossing the readouts it is about,
 * which reads as a rendering fault rather than as a drawer opening.
 *
 * <p>So the container sits at its final place, is clipped to its own bounds, and the <b>content</b>
 * is what moves inside it. The container's top edge is the strip's bottom edge, so the first frame
 * shows nothing and the panel appears to come out from under the strip. The clip is resized with the
 * container, because a clip is a fixed shape and a stale one crops the panel at its old height.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Motion is DISCRETE, and reduced motion skips it entirely</h2>
 *
 * {@code ui-design-language.md} §5 permits no easing and §9 lists easing curves as build-blocking, so
 * the slide is {@link Interpolator#DISCRETE} over {@link UiTokens#REVEAL_STEPS} steps — the same
 * ladder {@code Notifications} and the panel reveal use. Under reduced motion the panel is simply
 * there, which is also the better behaviour: the animation was never carrying any of the information.

     * pixels ABOVE the strip's. Anchoring the panel's top to the cell would put those few pixels of
     * panel over the strip — and this layer paints above {@code deckRoot}, so they would cover the

     * root is free to land on top of it. The desk is the wallpaper area, which is where a drawer
     * hanging off the strip belongs and the only place it can be without covering chrome. The

     * reached the rail; the chain-sync report passes the same field because the failure is latent
     * rather than absent — a narrow deck puts its left edge over the rail too.
