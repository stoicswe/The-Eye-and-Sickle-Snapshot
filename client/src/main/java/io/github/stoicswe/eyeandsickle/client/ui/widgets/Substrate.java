/**
 * The desk's wallpaper: a sparse field of machine texture, drifting behind every window.
 *
 * <h2>What this is, in the design language's own terms</h2>
 *
 * It is <b>greeble at desk scale</b>, and deliberately nothing more.
 * {@code docs/design/ui-design-language.md} §4 fixes the greeble vocabulary as "hex quads, block
 * glyphs, dots, 4-digit serials, {@code //} marks" and this uses exactly that alphabet and no other
 * — which is also why every non-ASCII character here is already proven present in IBM Plex Mono by
 * {@link Greeble}. §4's other requirement carries over unchanged: <b>it must stay unreadable</b>.
 * The moment a fragment resolves into a word, players start reading it, and a decorative string
 * being read is a string that is lying to them.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ It stands close to two rules, and neither is violated by accident</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>§9 still cuts vignette and bezel outright</b>, and §9.1 permits scanlines only as an
 *       effect the player switches on. This is neither: it is content, not an artefact laid over
 *       content, and it is <em>sparse and two-dimensional</em> rather than a raster overlay. There
 *       is no edge darkening anywhere, and no full-width horizontal rule in the alphabet — the
 *       fragments are short and separated by long gaps. It is also why rows drift at <b>three
 *       different rates</b> ({@link #DRIFT_RATES}): a field that slid as one sheet would read as a
 *       scrolling raster, and parallax is what stops it. (Scanlines proper live in
 *       {@code ui/CrtOverlay}, off by default, which is the arrangement §9.1 requires.)
 *   <li><b>§4 budgets greeble at "roughly 10–15% of pixels".</b> Occupancy here is held near
 *       {@value #TARGET_OCCUPANCY_PERCENT}% of <em>cells</em> — see {@link #GAP_MIN}/{@link #GAP_MAX}
 *       — and {@link #BLANK_ROW_CHANCE} of rows carry nothing at all, on top of a style class whose
 *       opacity puts it barely above the void it sits on. The desk is not the whole screen and the
 *       strips already spend part of that budget, which is the other half of why this is kept low.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Motion, and why it is a setting</h2>
 *
 * §5 allows step and linear timing only, so the field moves in <b>whole character cells</b> — a row
 * jumps one column or it does not move; nothing interpolates and nothing tweens. Beyond the
 * aesthetic, ambient motion behind the entire interface is an accessibility surface: <b>WCAG 2.2.2
 * (Pause, Stop, Hide)</b> requires that moving content which starts automatically and runs for more
 * than five seconds can be paused by the user. {@link WallpaperMode} is that control, which is why
 * {@link WallpaperMode#STILL} exists as a state of its own rather than being folded into "off" — a player
 * who wants the texture but not the movement should not have to choose between them.
 *
 * <p>Reduced motion is handled for free and correctly: the ticker is registered through
 * {@link Pulse#animate}, which classifies it as <em>decoration</em>, so
 * {@code prefers-reduced-motion} paints one resting frame and then holds it — the same state
 * {@link WallpaperMode#STILL} produces. Nothing here needs to ask.
 *
 * <h2>It is mouse-transparent, and that is load-bearing</h2>
 *
 * ⚠ {@code DeskManager} drops window focus on a press whose {@code getTarget()} is the desk itself.
 * A backdrop covering the desk would become that target and silently break focus-dropping on bare
 * desk, so this node must never accept a mouse event. Set here rather than at the call site,
 * because the constraint belongs to the thing that would violate it.
