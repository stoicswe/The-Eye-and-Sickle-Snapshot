/**
 * Personal heat as a graduated thermometer.
 *
 * <h2>Reconciling this with §2.2.4, which forbids a heat meter</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/client/01-visual-language.md} §2.2.4 is emphatic: <b>"Heat renders as a banded chip
 * carrying the band name, never as a continuous meter."</b> It gives two reasons, and this widget is
 * built to satisfy both rather than to argue with them.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><em>"A smooth bar invites a precision the model does not have."</em> — The stem is not
 *       smooth. It is eleven discrete cells divided into <b>five zones, one per band</b>, sized in
 *       proportion to each band's real range (0–10, 10–30, 30–55, 55–80, 80–100). The gaps between
 *       zones are the thresholds. Colour <b>steps</b> at a boundary and never interpolates across
 *       one. What the player reads is still "which band am I in", with the useful addition of "how
 *       close am I to the next one" — which serves the threshold decision §2.2.4 is protecting
 *       rather than undermining it.
 *   <li><em>"Trace is the only continuous red meter in the client, so heat and trace can never be
 *       confused."</em> — Trace is a continuous horizontal fill composed of labelled contribution
 *       segments (§2.2.5). This is a vertical, cell-based, zone-gapped column with a bulb. They do
 *       not resemble each other at any size, and the collision §2.2.4 was guarding against is
 *       structural rather than chromatic.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Where the band name went (UI-8, decided 2026-07-26)</h2>
 *
 * <b>The band name is not printed on the strip.</b> §2.2.4 requires the chip to "carry the band
 * name" and the strip cell is {@code KeyValue.keyOnly("Personal heat")} — label over thermometer, no
 * name. That was a deliberate call, confirmed when UI-8 was decided: the strip stays visually quiet
 * and the name lives in this widget's tooltip.
 *
 * <p>⚠ <b>It is a knowing departure from a contract, and one thing had to be done to keep it
 * honest.</b> {@code docs/client/07-accessibility.md} §5.2 forbids meaning resting on appearance
 * alone, and a hover tooltip is not an answer for anyone who does not hover — JavaFX tooltips are
 * mouse-only. So the band name is also set as this node's <b>accessible text</b>, which is the same
 * fix {@code CL-10} used for the gloss bar: the tooltip and the accessible name carry identical
 * content down two different paths. Visually the meaning still rests on the coloured bulb plus lit
 * cell count; §5.2 is satisfied for assistive technology and knowingly stretched for a sighted
 * player who does not hover. Recorded rather than assumed — if that trade stops being acceptable,
 * the fix is one line in {@code DeckShell}: {@code KeyValue.of("Personal heat", band.label())}.
 *
 * <h2>The bulb carries the band</h2>
 *
 * A thermometer's bulb is its reservoir, and colouring it with the <em>current</em> band makes the
 * answer to "which band am I in" readable without counting cells — which is the question §2.2.4 says
 * the player is actually asking.
