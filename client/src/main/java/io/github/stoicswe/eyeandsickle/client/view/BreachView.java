/**
 * The breach window — the core hacking minigame, played.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ THE TARGET LIST IS GONE (2026-08-10): this window shows the armed target and nothing else</h2>
 *
 * It used to carry a {@code BreachTargetList} — every attemptable machine and parasite, picked from
 * inside the window — and that made sense while the window was reachable on its own. It is not: since
 * the breach became its own window again it is <b>opened by arming</b>, the way a shell is opened by
 * connecting, and it is deliberately absent from {@code WindowSpec} so the rail cannot open a board
 * with nothing on it. A list inside it was therefore a <b>second target picker</b> beside the network
 * map, answering a question the player had already answered on the way in.
 *
 * <p>⚠ <b>Two pickers is worse than a redundant one.</b> They could disagree — the map arms a
 * machine, the list highlights another, and the single START BREACH button belongs to whichever wrote
 * `arming` last. Spending compute is the one act in this window that cannot be undone into a refund
 * ({@code docs/design/05} §4), so "which target did I just pay for" is the last question that should
 * have two surfaces offering an answer.
 *
 * <p>⚠ <b>Nothing is lost.</b> Everything the list could reach is reachable from where the player
 * already is: a machine from the network map's node menu, a parasite from the rig monitor's process
 * table — both of which show far more about the subject than a row here ever did.
 *
 * <p>⚠ <b>What replaces it is the IDLE PANEL, not empty space.</b> With nothing armed there is now no
 * other content, and a breach window that opened blank is indistinguishable from one that failed to
 * build. Exactly one of {breach, launch, idle} is on screen at every moment.
 *
 * <h2>Everything here is a readout of the port, and nothing here is a rule</h2>
 *
 * This view composes {@code ui/breach}'s renderers against {@link GameSession} and does not own a
 * single number the player could gain something by changing. It never asks {@code GameEngine} anything;
 * it asks {@code session.breach()} and draws what comes back. That is Invariant <b>I14</b> at the one
 * place it is easiest to break — a client that predicted an attention cost, or decided that a probe
 * was going to fail, would be authoritative over exactly the thing a cheater forges.
 *
 * <p>The consequence worth stating: the same window plays a solo breach in-process and a home
 * server's breach over REST, because it cannot tell the difference. If a method call here ever needs
 * to know which, the seam has already leaked.
 *
 * <h2>Cost before the click, itemisation after it — {@code docs/design/05} §4</h2>
 *
 * §4 makes the legibility of a loss a design constraint rather than a nicety: <em>"the player must
 * always be able to see which action cost what. A loss has to read as 'I was too loud', never 'the
 * game decided'."</em> Three surfaces carry that here and all three are always on screen while a
 * breach is live:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link CostStrip} prints every legal move's price <em>before</em> it is taken, affordable or
 *       not, and hover or focus previews that price on the meter.
 *   <li>{@link AttentionMeter} shows the budget as countable cells, with the points lost to strikes
 *       marked apart from the points spent on moves — the "I was too loud" mark.
 *   <li>{@link AttentionLedger} itemises every action after the fact, oldest first, never re-sorted.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The ledger deliberately stays on screen <b>after</b> the attempt resolves, underneath the
 * outcome slate. A resolution screen that showed the verdict and hid the arithmetic would be the
 * precise failure §4 forbids, and it would hide it at the only moment the player is actually asking
 * the question.
 *
 * <h2>What must not happen in a breach window</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>No focus theft.</b> {@code docs/client/00-client-overview.md} §2 (C5) calls it "the single
 *       most damaging thing this client could do", and it names the breach specifically. Nothing in
 *       {@code refresh} calls {@code requestFocus()}, and the abort control confirms in place rather
 *       than through a modal dialog — a dialog would take focus and the keyboard mid-puzzle.
 *   <li><b>No scene-graph rebuild per refresh.</b> Both class boards are built once and toggled;
 *       rebuilding them would drop the player's focus and their pointer target between two frames of
 *       a turn they are halfway through taking.
 *   <li><b>No decorative motion.</b> No {@code Motion.reveal}, no {@code Greeble}, no
 *       {@code Substrate}, no {@code SweepPanel} — per the amendment to {@code docs/client/01} §7.3
 *       (D-6): inside a live breach a surface may animate only when the motion <em>is</em> the
 *       readout, which is true of the widgets and of nothing this class adds.
 *   <li><b>No poll.</b> A breach is turn-based and changes only when an intent is dispatched, and
 *       every applied intent fires {@code onChange}. A {@code Pulse.every} here would repaint a
 *       static panel forever.
 * </ul>
