/**
 * The file manager — the rig's filesystem, and every machine mounted onto it.
 *
 * <h2>Nautilus's shape, this game's materials</h2>
 *
 * The layout is GNOME Files': a places sidebar on the left, a path bar across the top with back,
 * forward and up, and a detail list in the middle. That is not imitation for its own sake — it is the
 * arrangement an Ubuntu user already knows, and this window's whole purpose is that what a player
 * learns here transfers to a real machine. What it does <em>not</em> borrow is the chrome: no rounded
 * corners, no shadows, no icon grid of coloured folder pictures. The glyph vocabulary is the one the
 * rest of this client already uses, because a player who has learned to read the map should not have
 * to learn a second alphabet ({@code docs/design/ui-design-language.md} §9).
 *
 * <h2>⚠ A MOUNT IS A SESSION, and there is deliberately no second concept</h2>
 *
 * "Connect to Server" opens a shell session, and the machine appears in the sidebar. Unmounting
 * closes it. There is no separate mount state, no second compute cost and no second gate, and that is
 * the point: in Ubuntu, mounting a remote share <em>is</em> holding a connection open, and modelling
 * it twice here would give the game two lists of "machines I am attached to" that would eventually
 * disagree. Open a shell from the map and it is mounted here; mount it here and the shell is
 * available. One fact, two windows.
 *
 * <p>The consequence worth stating: a mount costs {@code Balance.SESSION_CYCLES} and needs a
 * foothold, exactly as a shell does. You cannot browse a machine you have not broken into — you can
 * see its shape and open nothing, which is also what a real port scan tells you.
 *
 * <h2>Readability is the rules' answer, rendered</h2>
 *
 * {@link FsEntry#readable} is set by the engine (I14). This window draws unreadable entries dimmed
 * and refuses to open them, but it never <em>decides</em> that — a file manager is the surface where
 * that mistake is easiest to make, because a path in a tree looks like something you could simply
 * open.

     * list answers one. What each section <em>contains</em> is this game's, and two of them earn

     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Shared</b> — machines you hold a foothold on but have not mounted. Finder's Shared
     *       section is "computers you could connect to", which is exactly what these are. Clicking
     *       one mounts it, which is what makes this better than the popup it replaces.
     *   <li><b>Locations</b> — this machine and, under it, everything currently mounted. Finder puts
     *       Network here and so do we.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>⚠ <b>iCloud Drive and AirDrop are deliberately absent</b>, and for different reasons.
     * iCloud was excluded by request. AirDrop has no analogue at all — there is no peer-to-peer
     * transfer in this game — and a sidebar entry that does nothing is worse than a missing one,
     * because it teaches a player that entries in this list may be decorative.
     *
     * <p>⚠ <b>The storage tiers are NOT here.</b> They moved into {@code ~/.VaultStore}, which is
     * hidden. A {@code Vault} entry in the sidebar of a machine an intruder is standing on is a
     * signpost to the one place that is supposed to be safe.
