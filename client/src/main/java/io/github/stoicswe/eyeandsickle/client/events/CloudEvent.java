/**
 * One event, in the <b>CloudEvents v1.0.2</b> envelope.
 *
 * <h2>Why a specification instead of a record of our own</h2>
 *
 * An event bus grows an ad-hoc envelope by default — whatever the first three publishers happened to
 * need — and by the time it matters that every event has a stable identity, a source and a timestamp,
 * there are forty publishers and no way to add them. CloudEvents has already made those decisions,
 * they are the right ones, and the format is understood by things outside this codebase. Conforming
 * costs one class; not conforming costs the ability to ever export the stream.
 *
 * <h2>The four REQUIRED attributes, and what each is for</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #id} — unique <em>per source</em>. The spec's own rule: producers MUST ensure
 *       {@code source + id} is unique for each distinct event. It is what makes a duplicate
 *       recognisable as a redelivery rather than as a second thing happening.
 *   <li>{@link #source} — a URI-reference naming <em>what produced this</em>. Not what it is about;
 *       {@link #subject} is that.
 *   <li>{@link #specversion} — {@code "1.0"}, fixed. Present so a reader never has to guess which
 *       revision of the rules an event was written under.
 *   <li>{@link #type} — reverse-DNS, describing what happened. The one attribute a subscriber
 *       usually filters on.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The validation here is the spec's, and it is enforced rather than documented</h2>
 *
 * Every rule below cites the section it comes from. They are checked in the compact constructor
 * because an envelope that is only conformant when everybody remembers the rules is not a conformant
 * envelope — and the one thing worse than no standard is a stream that claims to follow one.
 *
 * @param id §3.1.1 — REQUIRED, non-empty. Unique together with {@link #source}
 * @param source §3.1.1 — REQUIRED, non-empty URI-reference
 * @param specversion §3.1.1 — REQUIRED. Always {@link #SPEC_VERSION}
 * @param type §3.1.1 — REQUIRED, non-empty. SHOULD be prefixed with a reverse-DNS name
 * @param datacontenttype §3.1.2 — OPTIONAL, RFC 2046 media type
 * @param dataschema §3.1.2 — OPTIONAL, URI
 * @param subject §3.1.2 — OPTIONAL. <b>Non-empty if present</b>: what the event is <em>about</em>,
 *     within the source. A machine's address, a block height, a window id
 * @param time §3.1.2 — OPTIONAL, RFC 3339. {@link Instant} is exactly that
 * @param extensions §4 — extension context attributes. Names obey the same rules as the core ones
 * @param data §3 — the payload. Kept as a map so the log can render it without a serialiser
