/**
 * The network map as a character grid: the whole picture, computed with no scene graph.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a separate class from {@link NetGraph}</h2>
 *
 * Every geometric claim the map makes has to be testable without a display. The client bundles no
 * TestFX and no Monocle — {@code UiContractTest} says so in as many words, "a contract test that only
 * runs on a machine with a display is a contract test that does not run in CI".
 *
 * <p>⚠ <b>Measured, on this project, JavaFX 26.0.2 / JDK 26:</b> {@code new VBox()} succeeds with no
 * toolkit, and {@code new Label("x")} does <em>not</em> — it throws {@code ExceptionInInitializerError}
 * caused by {@code IllegalStateException: Toolkit not initialized}, from {@code Control}'s static
 * initialiser, before any constructor body runs. {@code Tooltip} fails the same way. So a renderer that
 * builds its picture out of {@code Label}s cannot be asserted on at all in this build, and splitting the
 * grid out is not tidiness — it is the difference between Lane C having tests and Lane C having none.
 * The routing, the merging, the occupancy mask and the packet therefore live here, in a class with no
 * JavaFX supertype, and {@link NetGraph} is the thin part that turns this grid into focusable
 * {@code Label}s. Both read the same grid, so the picture a test asserts on is the picture the player
 * sees, character for character.
 *
 * <h2>Merging is mandatory, and the occupancy mask is the second half of it</h2>
 *
 * Edges are drawn by OR-ing direction bits into cells through {@link AsciiCanvas#junction}, so two
 * edges crossing produce {@code ┼} and a fan-out produces {@code ┬}, rather than whichever edge the
 * loop reached last erasing the others. That is {@code CoreCage}'s z-buffer lesson in a different
 * shape.
 *
 * <p>⚠ {@link AsciiCanvas#bitsOf} returns {@code 0} for anything outside the sixteen-entry light
 * table — so routing across a cell holding {@code █}, {@code ·}, {@code ╪} or a label character would
 * silently replace it with a bare stub. {@code LatticeMap} gets away without a mask only because its
 * lanes can never cross a node cell; ours can, because a bridge stub is placed into a column the
 * layout did not allocate. Hence {@link Canvas#occupied}: every cell written by a header, a node cell,
 * a stub or a destination arrow is closed to routing, and {@link Canvas#merge} refuses rather than
 * overwrites.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ THE CORRIDOR IS THIRTEEN COLUMNS, NOT THREE — fixed 2026-08-08</h2>
 *
 * The distance from one layer's node box to the next is {@link UiTokens#NET_GAP_COLS} <b>plus</b> the
 * next layer's {@link UiTokens#NET_LATERAL_COLS}. A forward edge used to stop at the end of the gap,
 * which left its arrowhead pointing into ten blank columns — reported as "there is still a space", and
 * true of every forward arrow the map has ever drawn
 * ({@code docs/client/09-network-map-graph.md} §1.3). Lateral edges had the mirror-image defect: their
 * bracket sat at the <em>start</em> of the strip and stopped eight columns short of the box it joined.
 *
 * <p>Both are fixed by moving the lateral bracket to the far end of the strip, against the box
 * ({@link UiTokens#NET_LATERAL_BUS_COLS}), and running forward edges the full corridor. A forward run
 * then crosses lateral ink at exactly <b>one column</b>, and it <b>yields</b> there rather than merging
 * — see {@link Canvas#merge}. That is what "route around those two columns" comes to in a grid where
 * everything going left to right necessarily crosses every column: not a detour, but a single cell the
 * horizontal declines to claim, so the arc underneath survives intact and §1.2's shape distinction
 * holds by construction rather than by luck.
 *
 * <h2>Two edge classes, told apart by shape</h2>
 *
 * A <b>forward</b> edge crosses into the next hop layer and is drawn along the corridor with sharp
 * junctions and a {@code →} against the destination box. A <b>lateral</b> edge stays inside a layer
 * and is drawn in the two-column bracket on the left of its own boxes, with <em>rounded</em> corners.
 * The distinction is carried by the glyph, not by the ink: the map has to survive greyscale, and the
 * two kinds of edge mean genuinely different things — one is a hop the ceiling counts, the other is
 * not.
