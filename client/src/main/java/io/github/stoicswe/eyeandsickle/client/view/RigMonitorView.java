 * The allocation pane — where the rig's compute is, cell by cell.
 *
 * <h2>Compute is countable, not a percentage</h2>
 *
 * This view used to be a {@link javafx.scene.control.ProgressBar} and a list of consumers. It is now
 * the 100-cell grid {@code docs/design/ui-design-language.md} §4 calls the signature component, and
 * the change is not cosmetic. A bar at 97% says the rig is nearly full; a hundred cells with three
 * hollow ones says <em>you have three</em>, which is the number the player's next decision actually
 * turns on. {@code docs/design/01-core-resources.md} §1.2 makes cycles an integer resource — one
 * cell is one cycle, at every rig size, so the grid grows as the rig does rather than rescaling.
 *
 * <h2>The rig readout must add up, and must show it when it does not</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.1 makes catching a hidden miner a matter of noticing that the
 * numbers do not reconcile. That is only a skill if the numbers normally do — so nothing here is
 * rounded, smoothed or bucketed, and {@link ComputeBudget#unaccountedFor()} gets its own slice in
 * the grid rather than a line of text underneath it. Cycles being spent by something the rig cannot
 * name are drawn as blinking alarm cells, and the note beside them says what it is costing.
 *
 * <p>The slice is never synthesised. If the figure is zero the slice does not exist, so its
 * appearance always means something is wrong.

     * What "Free" does to each kind of consumer, and which kinds it is not offered for.

     *
     * Each branch below calls the same rule the player could have reached another way — stopping
     * self-mining, disarming a measure, ending a session — so the menu is a <b>shortcut to an
     * existing act</b> rather than a second way to take cycles back. That matters because the second
     * way would need its own answer to the Thermal Budget question, and would eventually give a
     * different one.
     *
     * <p>⚠ <b>The recovery curve is untouched and applies exactly as it already does.</b> Self-mining
     * and a shell RELEASE their cycles — they were held, not spent — while anything that was spent
     * comes back on the curve. Nothing here decides that; the rules do, and they decide it the same
     * way whether the player used this menu or the panel it shortcuts.
     *
     * <h2>⚠ Not offered is not the same as refused</h2>
     *
     * A running scan, a sweep's control channel, a bot frame, a relay hop and a parasite's cycles
     * have no stop verb in the rules — a sweep in flight is not cancellable, and a deployed miner's
     * cycles are the HOST's by <b>I6</b> and are not the player's to hand back at all. Those bands
     * get no menu rather than a menu that refuses: {@code docs/client/05} §5 wants a gate to say what
     * it is, and a disabled "Free" on a parasite would invite exactly the reading the grid works to
     * prevent — that unattributed capacity is something the player can simply dismiss.
     *
     * @param unmount takes the shell WINDOW off the desk; ending the session is the rules' half and
     *     is done here, but a window left behind on a session that no longer exists is a shell that
     *     answers nothing
