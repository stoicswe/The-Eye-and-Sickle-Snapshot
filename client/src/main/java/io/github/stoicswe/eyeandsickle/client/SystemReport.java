/**
 * What the client can truthfully say about itself and the machine it is running on.
 *
 * <p>Feeds the rig monitor's ABOUT tab. Every figure here is read from inside this JVM.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Nothing in this class starts a process or opens a host file</h2>
 *
 * That is a deliberate line, and it is the reason two of these readouts are less specific than an
 * operating system's own About box. The client has never spawned a subprocess and reads exactly one
 * file it did not write ({@code view/AvatarChooser}, under three conditions spelled out there). A
 * system-information panel is a weak reason to change either fact, so:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The CPU is reported by core count and architecture, not by marketing name.</b> There is
 *       no JVM API for the brand string. Getting {@code Apple M4 Max} means {@code sysctl} on
 *       macOS, {@code /proc/cpuinfo} on Linux and a WMI query on Windows — three platform paths,
 *       one of which is a process spawn.
 *   <li><b>The GPU is reported as the render pipeline, not as the adapter.</b> Measured against
 *       JavaFX 26: {@code GraphicsPipeline.getDeviceDetails()} returns context pointers and no
 *       adapter name, {@code GLFactory} is package-private and prints its driver information to
 *       stdout rather than returning it, and nothing public in {@code javafx.*} exposes
 *       {@code GL_RENDERER}. What the pipeline <em>does</em> answer is the question a player with a
 *       stuttering deck actually has — whether they are on hardware or have silently fallen back to
 *       software rendering.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If either is ever wanted literally, it is a new capability with a per-platform implementation
 * and a documented reason, not a quiet edit to this file.
 *
 * <h2>Everything here degrades rather than throws</h2>
 *
 * An About panel is the last place that should be able to take a window down, and half of what it
 * reads is optional at runtime: {@code com.sun.management} is a JDK extension, the prism pipeline is
 * an internal class reachable only on a classpath launch, and {@code build.properties} is absent if
 * someone runs the classes without Maven having filtered them. Each lookup answers {@link #UNKNOWN}
 * instead of failing.
