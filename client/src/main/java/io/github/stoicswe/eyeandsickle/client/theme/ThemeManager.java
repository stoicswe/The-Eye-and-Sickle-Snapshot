/**
 * Applies a theme to every Scene, and owns the reduced-motion decision.
 *
 * <h2>No AtlantaFX, and no user-agent stylesheet of our own</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/ui-design-language.md} §0 drops AtlantaFX. What replaces it is <em>less</em>,
 * not more: {@code theme.css} is loaded as an ordinary Scene stylesheet, and Modena stays underneath
 * as the toolkit's user-agent sheet.
 *
 * <p>That layering is deliberate. Replacing the user-agent stylesheet would mean re-specifying every
 * control JavaFX ships, including the dozens this client never instantiates — four thousand lines to
 * own so that a {@code ColorPicker} nobody opens looks right. Author stylesheets outrank the
 * user-agent sheet in the CSS cascade, so overriding the controls the client actually uses achieves
 * the same visual result with a surface small enough to read. The CONTROLS section of
 * {@code theme.css} is that override set, and an unstyled control is instantly obvious: it renders
 * as a rounded light-grey Modena box against a near-black deck.
 *
 * <h2>Live switching, in two assignments</h2>
 *
 * A theme is {@code theme.css} plus an optional palette overlay ({@link ThemeId}), so switching is
 * removing two stylesheets and adding one or two. Nothing is rebuilt and no Scene is recreated — a
 * player comparing the deck against high-visibility should be able to flip back and forth and watch
 * the same numbers redraw.
 *
 * <h2>Reduced motion, and a correction to the design document</h2>
 *
 * §10 criterion 8 of the design language says "JavaFX cannot read the OS preference; expose it
 * explicitly and default it off." <b>The first half of that is wrong.</b>
 * {@code Platform.getPreferences().isReducedMotion()} exists, is observable, and is read here — the
 * client has honoured it since before the design language was written. The criterion's practical
 * advice still stands and is implemented: there is an explicit Settings toggle, and an explicit
 * choice overrides the system one in both directions.
 *
 * <p>Getting this right matters more than the usual documentation nit. Defaulting reduced motion off
 * while ignoring the OS setting means a player who has asked their whole system to stop animating
 * gets a greeble field regenerating every four seconds until they find a toggle.

     * opening in the previous character's colours, which looks like the per-character setting having
