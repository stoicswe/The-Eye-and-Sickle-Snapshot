/**
 * The casing drawn around the deck — the cyberdeck's physical frame.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ This is a BEZEL, which §9 cut twice. Read this before extending it.</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/ui-design-language.md} §9 listed bezel as build-blocking and §9.1 pointedly
 * kept it cut when four other screen artefacts were permitted: <em>"a drawn monitor casing, screen
 * curvature, or any frame implying the interface sits inside a pictured device. Still cut, without
 * exception."</em> It is permitted now on explicit direction, by the same mechanism and under the
 * same four conditions §9.1 established — which are what make the amendment safe rather than a hole
 * in the list:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Off by default and switchable off permanently.</b> {@link #OFF} is the default and the
 *       shipped look is unchanged for anyone who does not go looking. An effect the player switches
 *       on is a costume; an effect welded to the interface is a claim about fidelity the interface
 *       then has to keep making while they are trying to read a number.
 *   <li><b>It may not cost legibility.</b> This is the condition that shaped the implementation:
 *       the frame is drawn in a <b>margin</b>, and the deck is inset by exactly that margin. It
 *       never overlays content. A casing painted on top of the top strip would hide the compute
 *       readout, which is client pillar C2 and structural.
 *   <li><b>No blur, no glow.</b> §9's ban is unchanged and machine-checked. Every style here is
 *       flat fills and hairlines with hard edges — the same vocabulary the panels already use.
 *   <li><b>What moves obeys §5.</b> ⚠ This condition read "nothing here moves" until
 *       {@link #TERMINAL} landed with blinking status lamps. The rule was never "a casing must be
 *       still" — §9.1's actual condition is that motion artefacts step rather than tween and that
 *       {@code prefers-reduced-motion} stops them. The lamps run on {@code Pulse.animate}, the
 *       decorative channel, which is exactly that. Every other style is still inert.
 *       <p>⚠ Reduced motion freezes the lamps <b>lit</b>, not dark. A panel whose indicators all
 *       went out would read as powered off — a wrong statement about the machine, where a still
 *       lamp is merely a less lively one.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>⚠ <b>Vignette is still cut, and this does not reopen it.</b> §9's argument against it is not
 * about frames — it is that a vignette "dims real content by position rather than by meaning, and
 * the corners are where tiled windows go". A bezel in a margin dims nothing, because no content is
 * ever underneath it.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ JavaFX-free on purpose</h2>
 *
 * Same reason as {@link WallpaperMode}, {@link WindowSize} and {@code cursors/CursorSkin}: it can be
 * read, persisted and tested without a toolkit.
