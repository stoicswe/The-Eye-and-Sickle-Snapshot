/**
 * The operator's picture — the one they set, or the one the rig makes up for them.
 *
 * <h2>The default is generated, not shipped</h2>
 *
 * A player who has not chosen a picture gets a silhouette torn up by static. It is drawn from the
 * handle, so it is <b>theirs</b> — two operators get different noise — and it is drawn rather than
 * loaded because a shipped placeholder is a file to package for five platforms in exchange for one
 * image nobody chose.
 *
 * <p>⚠ The silhouette is deliberately unflattering. A neutral grey head reads as "loading"; a figure
 * breaking up under interference reads as <em>somebody who has not told you who they are</em>, which
 * is the correct thing for this game to say about an operator with no picture. It is also the state
 * the interface most wants the player to leave, and a placeholder that looks finished never gets
 * replaced.
 *
 * <h2>Pixels, not a Canvas</h2>
 *
 * Everything here returns {@code int[]} ARGB. That makes it encodable by {@link Png} and checkable
 * without a toolkit — a generator that drew onto a {@code Canvas} could only be tested by starting
 * JavaFX, and this one has real arithmetic in it worth testing.
