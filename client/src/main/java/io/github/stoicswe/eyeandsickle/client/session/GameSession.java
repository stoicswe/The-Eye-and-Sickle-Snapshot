/**
 * Everything the interface can ask the game, and everything it can ask the game to do.
 *
 * <h2>One port, two worlds</h2>
 *
 * A view binds to this and never learns whether it is talking to a rules engine three method calls
 * away ({@link LocalGameSession}) or a home server across a network. That is not architectural
 * tidiness for its own sake — it is what makes the offline mode honest. If the single-player build
 * had its own screens, single player would drift into a different game; because it does not, the
 * rig monitor a solo player reads is the rig monitor an online player reads.
 *
 * <h2>Why every mutation returns an {@link Outcome} instead of throwing</h2>
 *
 * Client pillar **C4** ({@code docs/client/00-client-overview.md} §2) says the client never claims
 * authority it does not have, and {@code docs/client/04-terminology-and-education.md} §3.5 makes that
 * structural by giving refusal and unreachability different exit statuses. A refusal is a normal,
 * expected answer — the server (or the rules) considered the request and declined — so it is a return
 * value. Exceptions are for the cases where the question could not be asked at all.
 *
 * <p>The distinction shows up on screen: "the server refused this" and "we could not reach the
 * server" must never collapse into one message ({@code docs/client/01-visual-language.md} §9.4).
 *
 * <h2>Threading</h2>
 *
 * Implementations are called from the JavaFX application thread and must not block it. The local
 * implementation is synchronous because it is arithmetic; a remote one must do its I/O elsewhere and
 * deliver results back through {@link #onChange}.
