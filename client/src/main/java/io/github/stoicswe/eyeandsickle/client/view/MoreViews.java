 * {@code docs/design/05} (the breach minigame), {@code 10} (bots) and {@code 12}/{@code 14} (social,
 * narrative) are marked <b>[PROPOSAL]</b>, and {@code CLAUDE.md} asks that proposals be surfaced
 * rather than hard-committed in code. So these windows now render everything that <em>is</em> decided
