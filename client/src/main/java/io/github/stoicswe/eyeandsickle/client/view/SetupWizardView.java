/**
 * The setup assistant — one question at a time, before the character exists.
 *
 * <h2>What this is for, and why it is not just the Settings window</h2>
 *
 * Every choice here is already in Settings, and a player can change all of them later. That is not a
 * redundancy — it is the point. A new player who is handed a deck with twenty tool windows has no
 * idea that the pointer is theirs to pick, that there are six palettes, or that the game will stop
 * explaining Unix if they ask it to. <b>Settings answers a question the player already has; a setup
 * assistant tells them the question exists.</b> The teaching level (CL-4 / T-2) is the clearest case:
 * it materially changes the game, its default is right for one audience and wrong for another, and it
 * used to be asked in a bare {@code Alert} on first run.
 *
 * <p>Modelled on macOS's Setup Assistant, down to the shape: one decision per pane, a large title, a
 * short paragraph of consequence, the control, and <b>Continue</b> in the bottom right. Nothing on a
 * pane competes with the thing the pane is asking.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Global settings, per-character wizard — and how that is resolved</h2>
 *
 * Only two of these values belong to the character: the <b>handle</b> and the <b>picture</b>. Theme,
 * pointer, motion, text size, hostname and teaching level are all
 * <b>profile-global</b> — one per install, shared by every character. macOS has the same split and
 * dodges it by asking the long questions only on first boot.
 *
 * <p>This asks every time, because a player creating their second character is <em>also</em> a player
 * who might now want the high-visibility palette. What makes that safe is that <b>every global page
 * is seeded from the value that is already set</b>: pressing Continue through the whole wizard
 * changes nothing. The alternative — a short wizard for later characters — was rejected because it
 * hides the one screen that tells a player these options exist.
 *
 * <p>⚠ And because the globals are applied <em>live</em>, {@link #create} snapshots them on entry and
 * {@code Actions.cancel} puts them all back. A player who opens the wizard, tries three palettes and
 * backs out has not silently re-themed the character they were already playing.
 *
 * <h2>Live preview, because a palette cannot be chosen from its name</h2>
 *
 * Selecting a theme applies it to the wizard itself, immediately — "Phosphor" is not a decision
 * anybody can make from the word. The same for pointer, motion and text size. Each pane is therefore
 * both the question and the answer's consequence.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The picture is chosen before there is anywhere to put it</h2>
 *
 * {@code session.setAvatar} needs a session, and there is no session until the character is created —
 * which happens when this screen finishes. So the encoded PNG rides out through
 * {@code Actions.begin(slot, handle, avatarPng)} and the client applies it once the save exists. The
 * generated silhouette shown on the way is the real one: {@link Avatar#placeholder} is derived from
 * the handle, so it is already <em>theirs</em> as soon as they have typed a name.

     * This is the opposite: the terms the world is built under, chosen before it exists, in the open,
     * at the moment every other game asks the same question. The test that separates them is whether
     * the player could have got here by playing: a twelve-server world is one you could have been
     * given; a compute ceiling past the top of the ladder is not.
     *
     * <h2>⚠ Every control's default reproduces the game as it ships</h2>
     *
     * "Random" on both sizes, the tuned cross-link rate, 100% events, and whatever the game's own
     * starting balance is. A player who walks through this pane pressing Continue gets exactly the
     * character they would have got before it existed — which is what makes adding it safe.
     *
     * <h2>⚠ The two size settings are GENERATION inputs and are read once</h2>
     *
     * The foot line says so, because a player who later finds these under Settings and edits them
     * would reasonably expect their map to change, and it cannot: the generator runs once per
     * character by design, which is the same guard that stops a world being re-rolled.
