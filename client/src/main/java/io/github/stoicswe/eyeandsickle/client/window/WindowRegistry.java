/**
 * Which tool windows exist, which are open, and where they are.
 *
 * <p>{@code docs/client/05-tool-windows-and-layout.md} §1.5 calls this "the implementation shape
 * everything else assumes", and three of its sections are really specifications for this class.
 *
 * <h2>The accelerator-installation trap (§3.6)</h2>
 *
 * A JavaFX accelerator registered on one {@code Scene} fires only while that Scene has focus. For a
 * shortcut whose entire job is to raise a window you <em>cannot see</em>, that is exactly backwards —
 * {@code Shortcut+4} would work only when the audit window was already in front of you. So every
 * accelerator is installed on <em>every</em> Stage as it is created, and on every Stage created later.
 * This is the single most likely thing to be broken by a well-meaning refactor, which is why it is one
 * method with a loud name.
 *
 * <h2>A saved position may no longer be a place (§3.8)</h2>
 *
 * Monitors get unplugged. A window restored to a coordinate on a screen that no longer exists is
 * invisible and, worse, focusable — so the player can hear it respond and never find it. Every
 * restore is checked against the current screen layout and falls back to the primary screen's centre
 * if the remembered position is not on any of them.
