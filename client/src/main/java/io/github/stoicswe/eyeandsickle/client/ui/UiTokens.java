 * <h2>Why this class has to exist at all</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/ui-design-language.md} §7.2 names the gap: JavaFX <b>looked-up colours are
 * colours only</b>. There is no numeric equivalent of a CSS custom property, so a spacing scale
 * expressed in CSS would be sixty literal {@code 9px}s that drift apart one commit at a time. The
 * split the design language mandates is therefore: <b>colours live in {@code theme.css} and nothing
 * else does; sizes, spacings and durations live here and nowhere else.</b>
 *
 * <p>That split is also what makes §10 criterion 2 — "no hex literals in Java" — checkable rather
 * than aspirational, and {@code UiTokensTest} checks it across the whole {@code ui} package.
 *
 * <h2>The scale is tight on purpose</h2>
 *
 * §2.3 fixes it at {@code 1, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14} and nothing between. Density is the aesthetic; a 16px
 * gutter appearing because a panel "felt cramped" is the first step towards the failure mode §1
 * names — <em>a competent dark-mode developer tool</em>.
