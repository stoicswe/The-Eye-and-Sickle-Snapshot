/**
 * The rig monitor's ABOUT tab: the mascot, and what the client can truthfully say about the machine.
 *
 * <h2>Mr. Monitor is the one hand-drawn thing in the client, and that is the point</h2>
 *
 * Every other mark on screen is drawn by the toolkit from a token — a rectangle, a hairline, a cell.
 * uOS's mascot is a picture a person drew, and putting it here rather than on the splash or the
 * login screen is deliberate: those two are the rig's <em>firmware</em> and its <em>login</em>, two
 * fictions that predate the operating system. The About panel is the only surface in the client
 * where uOS is talking about itself, which is the one place a mascot belongs.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Drawn at a fixed width with the ratio preserved, never at a fixed box</h2>
 *
 * Setting both {@code fitWidth} and {@code fitHeight} on an {@code ImageView} stretches the image to
 * fill them, and a stretched drawing is worse than a small one. One dimension is set,
 * {@code preserveRatio} does the other, and {@code UiTokens.MASCOT_WIDTH} is the only number
 * involved — sizes live in tokens (CLAUDE.md), including this one.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing here is game state</h2>
 *
 * The panel takes no {@code GameSession} and holds no timer. It is built once and never refreshed:
 * the client's version does not change while it is running, and neither does the host's memory. That
 * makes this the second window surface after {@code calc} that required checking no invariant —
 * {@code I14} is about state a cheater would forge, and how much RAM the player has is not the
 * server's opinion.
