/**
 * Every non-ASCII character the network map draws that {@link AsciiCanvas} does not already name.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ This file is the network map's glyph blast radius</h2>
 *
 * The implementation spec makes this <b>the second file in the client permitted to carry box-drawing and
 * block-element literals</b>, {@link AsciiCanvas} being the first, and says plainly: do not introduce a
 * third vocabulary. So every glyph {@link NetLayout}, {@link NetCanvas}, {@link NetGraph} and
 * {@link NetLegend} draw arrives from here or from {@code AsciiCanvas}. The audit for "does the bundled
 * font actually contain this?" stays two files and one {@code grep}.
 *
 * <p>The only non-ASCII characters left elsewhere in this package are two em dashes in player-facing
 * prose in {@link NetGraph}, which are punctuation rather than vocabulary — the same exemption
 * {@code AsciiCanvas} records for the three in the breach package, and measured present in both bundled
 * faces rather than assumed.
 *
 * <p>That audit is {@code GlyphCoverageTest}, which parses the bundled TTF {@code cmap} and fails the
 * build on any character absent from IBM Plex Mono. It exists because the characters a network renderer
 * reaches for by reflex are precisely the ones that are missing: the whole Geometric Shapes block
 * (U+25A0–U+25FF) has <b>one</b> character in Plex, the lozenge, so {@code ● ○ ◆ ■ ▲}, which is what a
 * node marker wants to be, are none of them present. That absence is the reason a node here is
 * <em>two block-element cells</em> rather than a shape: the block-element range is complete in Plex, and
 * two cells is also the aspect correction, since a character cell is about twice as tall as it is wide
 * and a single cell would read as a vertical sliver.
 *
 * <h2>Weight first, colour second</h2>
 *
 * Every state distinction on the map is carried by a <em>different character</em> before it is carried by
 * an ink level: {@code ██} vantage, {@code ▓▓} foothold, {@code ▒▒} identified, {@code ░░} contact. The
 * map has to survive greyscale, and it has to survive the palette rule that {@code -es-amber} means
 * live/earning data — a network node is not earning, so there is no amber here to lean on even if the
 * design language allowed it.
 *
 * <h2>Rounded corners are load-bearing, not decoration</h2>
 *
 * {@link #ROUND_TL} and friends are how a <em>lateral</em> edge (one that stays inside a hop layer) is
 * told apart from a <em>forward</em> edge (one that crosses into the next), <b>by shape rather than by
 * colour</b>. They were measured present in IBM Plex Mono and absent from Martian Mono — which is fine,
 * because the whole map is pinned to Plex, and it is one more reason it must stay pinned.
