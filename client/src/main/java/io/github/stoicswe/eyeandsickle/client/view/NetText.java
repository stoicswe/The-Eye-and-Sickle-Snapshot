/**
 * The network, as text — the one renderer both the map window and the terminal print through.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a class and not two copies of a format string</h2>
 *
 * Pillar <b>C1</b> ({@code docs/client/00-client-overview.md} §2) requires everything a tool window
 * can do to be reachable from the terminal and the reverse. That is usually read as "add a verb",
 * but the harder half is that the two surfaces must keep <em>agreeing</em>: a player who learns to
 * read {@code ADDRESS SERVER HOPS KIND TIER STATE NOTE} in the map window and then types
 * {@code net} should get the same seven columns in the same order at the same widths, not a second
 * dialect of the same data. {@code BreachCommands}' ledger comment states the rule for the breach —
 * "column order matches the window's, so a player who reads one can read the other" — and keeps it
 * by hand. This keeps it by construction: there is exactly one row renderer and both callers use it.
 *
 * <h2>Pure, and deliberately free of JavaFX</h2>
 *
 * Nothing here touches a scene graph, which is what lets the column arithmetic and the empty state
 * be tested headlessly. No test in this module starts the JavaFX toolkit today, and this class is
 * where the parts worth asserting on live so that none of them has to.
 *
 * <h2>What it may and may not say</h2>
 *
 * Every field printed here comes off {@link NetMap}, which is the player's knowledge and not ground
 * truth. In particular {@link HostKind#UNKNOWN} renders as {@code --------} rather than being
 * guessed from anything else on the row: naming a node's type is what the 15 EC Passive Sniffer
 * sells ({@code docs/design/07-recon-tools.md} §1), and a renderer that inferred it would delete a
 * purchased tool at the point of drawing. A sweep sells existence and adjacency; nothing more
 * reaches this class, so nothing more can leak out of it.
