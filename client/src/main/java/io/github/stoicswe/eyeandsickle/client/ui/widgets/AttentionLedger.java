/**
 * Every move, what it cost, and what came back.
 *
 * <h2>This is the most load-bearing widget in the feature</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/05-hacking-minigame.md} §4 states the constraint it exists to satisfy:
 * <b>"the player must always be able to see which action cost what. A loss has to read as 'I was too
 * loud', never 'the game decided'."</b> Everything else in the breach can be beautiful and the
 * feature still fails if this list is wrong, incomplete or hard to scan. That is also why the engine
 * appends a row for a move that was <em>refused in fiction</em> — a gap in the ledger is the bug, not
 * a quiet outcome.
 *
 * <h2>Append only, never re-sorted</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/client/01-visual-language.md} §7.3 forbids "anything that reorders a list the player
 * may be pointing at". Rows arrive newest-at-the-bottom and stay where they were put. The
 * corollary is the scroll rule below, which is the same courtesy one level up.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The scroll only follows a reader who is already at the bottom</h2>
 *
 * Yanking the viewport to the end while somebody is three rows up re-reading how they blew a strike
 * is the single most irritating thing a log surface can do, and it is a real risk here because every
 * intent appends. The position is sampled <em>before</em> the rebuild and only restored to the end
 * if it was already there.
 *
 * <h2>Colour is the last channel, not the first</h2>
 *
 * A strike row carries the word {@code STRIKE} and its own alarm class; a quiet read is dim; a loud
 * tool is bright. Take every colour away and the rows still sort into three kinds by their text,
 * which is what {@code docs/client/07-accessibility.md} §5.2 asks for. Strike rows are one of the two
 * alarm uses §2.1 permits on this screen — the other is the attention meter's lost cells, and they
 * are the same event seen twice, which is the point.
