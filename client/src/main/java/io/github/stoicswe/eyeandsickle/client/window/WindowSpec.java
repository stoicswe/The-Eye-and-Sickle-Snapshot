/**
 * The tool-window catalogue, transcribed from {@code docs/client/05-tool-windows-and-layout.md} §2.1.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is an enum and not a config file</h2>
 *
 * The catalogue is closed. {@code docs/client/05} §2.2 is explicit that adding a window is a
 * documented decision rather than a convenience — it added {@code comms} and {@code settings} and
 * said so, rather than quietly extending a table another document owns. An enum makes the set
 * closed in the compiler, makes the switcher exhaustive by construction, and makes a test able to
 * assert the whole table against the document.
 *
 * <h2>The rule the minimum sizes obey</h2>
 *
 * No window's minimum may exceed <b>720×480</b>, so that any two tools fit side by side on a
 * 1366×768 laptop with the rig strip still visible. That is not a style guideline — it is what keeps
 * the multi-window fantasy usable on the machine most players actually have, and {@link
 * #MAX_MINIMUM_WIDTH} exists so a test can enforce it rather than a reviewer having to notice.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Accelerators are POSITIONAL, not mnemonic (reassigned 2026-08-05)</h2>
 *
 * The rail reads {@code 0 1 2 3 4 R F G A S D T X / ,} top to bottom, and the enum's declaration order
 * IS the rail order — so the binding a player learns is where the tool sits, not what it is called.
 * That is a deliberate trade and it cost something real: {@code market} was <b>B</b> because "B is
 * the one accelerator a player will reach for without being told", {@code files} was <b>H</b> for
 * Home, {@code calc} was <b>C</b>. Those mnemonics are gone.
 *
 * <p>⚠ <b>{@code Shortcut+F} now opens the network map, and §6.3 reserves it for per-window find.</b>
 * Nothing collides today — no window binds find — so no test fails, and {@code FILES} carries the
 * note explaining why it used to avoid F. The day a find bar is added, one of the two has to move.
 *
 * <p>⚠ Every one is a plain {@code Shortcut+key}: five of them required Shift before and now do not,
 * which is what makes the row read as a sequence rather than as a list of exceptions.
