/**
 * What the desk wallpaper is doing: off, still, or drifting.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a three-state enum and not a boolean</h2>
 *
 * <b>WCAG 2.2.2 (Pause, Stop, Hide)</b> requires that moving content which starts automatically and
 * runs for more than five seconds can be paused by the user. A wallpaper behind the entire interface
 * is exactly that, so a pause has to exist. Folding it into "off" would satisfy the letter and lose
 * the point: a player who wants the texture but not the movement would have to give up both, and the
 * texture is what {@code docs/design/ui-design-language.md} §4 protects as "the single largest
 * difference between this look and a dashboard".
 *
 * <h2>Why it is a top-level enum rather than nested in the widget</h2>
 *
 * So it can be read, persisted and tested <em>without a JavaFX toolkit</em>. {@code Substrate}
 * extends {@code Region}, and touching it from a unit test would drag in a live toolkit — which
 * {@code UiContractTest}'s own comment rules out: "a contract test that only runs on a machine with
 * a display is a contract test that does not run in CI." Same shape and same reason as
 * {@code ui/cursors/CursorSkin}.
