/**
 * The rig monitor's six views, and the columns each one shows.
 *
 * <h2>Why five tabs and not one wide table</h2>
 *
 * Activity Monitor's split is not arbitrary and copying it is not imitation: <b>each tab is a
 * question</b>. "What is eating the processor" and "what is holding the memory" have different answers
 * and different columns, and a single table wide enough for both is a table nobody scrolls sideways to
 * read. Splitting it also makes the tabs a diagnostic instrument in their own right — a parasite that
 * hides well on CPU is conspicuous on NETWORK, and the player who thinks to look is rewarded for it.
 *
 * <h2>The order is fixed and it is the order of escalation</h2>
 *
 * Overview first, because it is the panel that was already there and the one a player opens by
 * reflex. Then CPU, MEMORY, DISK, NETWORK — cheapest signal to most specific. A player who suspects
 * something walks rightwards. {@link #ABOUT} is appended after that ladder rather than inserted into
 * it, for the reason given on the constant.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Every column is a fact the process genuinely reports</h2>
 *
 * There is no column that means "suspicious", no score, and no derived verdict. The tells this table
 * carries are <em>relationships</em> — a CPU figure against its own accumulated CPU time, a user
 * against every other user in the list, a name against the daemon one row below it — and a column that
 * did the comparing would remove the only skill involved. See {@code solo/proc/Disguise}.
