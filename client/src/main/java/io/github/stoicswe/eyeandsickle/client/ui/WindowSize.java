/**
 * The sizes the deck window can be set to, as common display resolutions.
 *
 * <h2>Why this has to exist at all</h2>
 *
 * The deck is one {@code StageStyle.UNDECORATED} Stage (§0), which means there is <b>no OS window
 * chrome</b> — and therefore no OS resize handle. Until this existed the window was created at a
 * hard-coded 1280×800 on every launch and the only sizes reachable were that one and maximised.
 * Drawing our own chrome bought the look and quietly took away a thing every other window on the
 * machine can do; this is the half of that trade that had not been paid.
 *
 * <h2>Why presets rather than a width and height field</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/ui-design-language.md} §10 criterion 9 asks the layout to hold from 1280 to
 * 2560px, and §3 specifies a breakpoint at 900. Those are the numbers worth testing against, and a
 * free-text pair of boxes invites the sizes between them that nobody has ever looked at. A player
 * who wants an arbitrary size still has one — drag the window to an edge, or maximise it.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ JavaFX-free on purpose</h2>
 *
 * Same reason as {@link WallpaperMode} and {@code cursors/CursorSkin}: it can be read, persisted and
 * tested without a toolkit. {@code UiContractTest}'s own comment rules the alternative out — "a
 * contract test that only runs on a machine with a display is a contract test that does not run in
 * CI". {@link #fitsOnScreen} is the whole clamping rule and is exercised without ever opening a Stage.
