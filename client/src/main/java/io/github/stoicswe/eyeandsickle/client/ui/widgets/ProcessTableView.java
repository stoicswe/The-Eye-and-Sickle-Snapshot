/**
 * The process table: sortable columns, one row per process, and a menu on each.
 *
 * <h2>Character cells, not a {@code TableView}</h2>
 *
 * The same call {@code NetHostList} makes and for the same reasons. A {@code TableView} brings Modena
 * with it — {@code docs/design/ui-design-language.md} §9 rejects its radius, its shadows and its
 * proportional type — and it would give this panel a selection model, a focus model and a sort
 * comparator that all have to be re-taught the house style. A fixed-width text row gives per-row hit
 * testing, a keyboard route, a focus ring and an accessible sentence, and it lines up down the column,
 * which is the only property that matters here: <b>this table exists to be compared down a column.</b>
 *
 * <h2>⚠ No row is styled by what it is</h2>
 *
 * A parasite hides here by looking like the rows around it, and every tell is in the data. There is
 * deliberately no "suspicious" class, no alarm ramp and no ordering that floats anything to the top —
 * a renderer that highlighted the answer would turn {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.1's
 * investigation into a game of spot-the-red-row. The only visual distinction any row gets is whether
 * it is <em>selected</em>, which is the player's own doing.
 *
 * <h2>Sorting is the instrument</h2>
 *
 * It is how two of the disguises are actually caught: sort by CPU and a resource hog surfaces; sort by
 * name and a typosquat lands next to the daemon it is imitating. So the header is not decoration and
 * the sort must be <b>reversible</b> — clicking a column twice gives the reverse order — and
 * <b>stable at equal values</b>, or two rows the comparator cannot separate would swap on every
 * repaint.
 *
 * <p>⚠ <b>Rows genuinely move, and that is the feature.</b> The figures advance on a five-second tick
 * ({@code Vitals}), so a table sorted by %CPU visibly re-orders as processes get busier and quieter —
 * the same thing a real monitor does, and the thing that makes a row which stays pinned at the top
 * worth a second look.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ It repaints on its own clock, not on the session's</h2>
 *
 * The session fires a change when the <em>game</em> changes, which on an idle rig can be never. A
 * table that only repainted then would freeze the moment the player stopped doing anything — exactly
 * when they are most likely to be reading it. So this holds a {@link Pulse#every} subscription, which
 * is the non-decorative driver and therefore still fires under reduced motion: this is instrumentation,
 * not animation, and a player who has asked for less movement has not asked for stale numbers.
