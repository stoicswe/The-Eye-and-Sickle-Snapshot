/**
 * {@code SYNCHRONIZING} — the chain catching up on what it did while the client was closed.
 *
 * <h2>Why a load needs a screen at all</h2>
 *
 * The chain runs whether or not this client does ({@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §1.3d), so a
 * character opened after four days away arrives at a height several hundred blocks past the one they
 * left. Applying that silently would replace one wrong impression with another: a player who left at
 * 4 412 and opened at 4 463 with no explanation has no way to tell a chain that ran without them from
 * a save that had been tampered with — and §3.1 spends the whole game training them to treat exactly
 * that kind of unexplained jump as evidence.
 *
 * <p>So the fill is <b>shown</b>. What it reports is what actually happened: how many blocks, over
 * what span, how many of them the rig was still hashing for, how many retargets closed, and how many
 * of the player's own transactions were mined while they were gone.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The replay is theatre over work that is already finished, and the timing says so</h2>
 *
 * {@code ChainRules.sync} ran to completion inside {@code resume()} before this panel existed. The
 * meter is therefore paced by a <b>fixed step count over a fixed duration</b> rather than by blocks:
 * 51 blocks and 5 100 blocks take the same {@link #STEPS} steps, because the honest thing a progress
 * bar can report here is "how far through showing you this am I", and pretending to be watching work
 * happen would be inventing a wait the player never had.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Three design-language constraints, each of which the obvious implementation violates</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>{@code Pulse.animate}, never {@code AnimationTimer}.</b> §5.1 rations continuous ramps to
 *       two files by name and {@code UiContractTest} asserts it. {@code animate} is also the right
 *       <em>kind</em>: this is decoration over a completed fact, so under reduced motion it fires
 *       exactly once — and {@link #render} reads {@link Pulse#reducedMotion()} and paints the
 *       finished state on that single call, rather than freezing a bar at 2%.
 *   <li><b>A {@link CellMeter}, never a continuous bar.</b> §4, and this is a measurement, so §9.3's
 *       rounded-corner opt-in must not reach it either — a cell with a soft corner reads as a
 *       smaller cell, and discrete meters exist to be counted.
 *   <li><b>Its own strip, not a modal.</b> The deck draws its own window manager and has no modal
 *       layer; more to the point, a player who came back to check one figure should not have to
 *       dismiss a dialog to reach it. The panel sits at the top of the CHAIN tab and collapses to
 *       nothing when there is nothing to report.
 * </ul>
