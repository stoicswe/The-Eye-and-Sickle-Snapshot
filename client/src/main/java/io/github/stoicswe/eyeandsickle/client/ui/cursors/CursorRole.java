 * reticle fills its centre gap, the block inverts — instead of every skin being obliged to draw a
 * hand.
 *
 * <p>Each role also carries the platform cursor it falls back to, so {@link CursorSkin#SYSTEM} and
 * any failure to build an image both degrade to exactly the conventional pointer rather than to
