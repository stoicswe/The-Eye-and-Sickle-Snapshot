/**
 * Noise, drawn as a sound meter rather than as a level.
 *
 * <h2>Why a bar was the wrong instrument</h2>
 *
 * Noise was a single filled bar, which reads as a <em>quantity</em> — like fuel, or storage used.
 * But noise is not a quantity the player accumulates; it is how much racket the rig is making right
 * now, and it decays. A bank of columns that move says that in a way a bar cannot: a quiet rig
 * twitches along the bottom, a loud one is alive across its whole width. The player learns to read
 * the <em>motion</em>, which is exactly the peripheral signal a status strip should carry.
 *
 * <p>It also stays inside §4's rule — "3px × 9px cells with 1px gaps, never a continuous bar or
 * gradient". This is that rule in two dimensions instead of one.
 *
 * <h2>Peak hold, because the interesting number is the spike</h2>
 *
 * Every column keeps its recent maximum as a single detached cell that sinks a step at a time. That
 * is a real VU-meter mechanism and it earns its place here: a burst of noise that has already
 * decayed is still the thing that got the player noticed, and without a peak hold it would be gone
 * before they looked up.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * Each frame is a discrete recomputation of integer cell counts — §5's step timing, not an
 * interpolation, so nothing here is an easing curve in disguise. Under reduced motion the columns
 * freeze at the true level with no jitter and no peaks, which is still an honest reading.
