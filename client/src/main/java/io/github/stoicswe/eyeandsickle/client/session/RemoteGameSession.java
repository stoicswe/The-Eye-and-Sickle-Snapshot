/**
 * A session against a home server.
 *
 * <h2>The last-known-good rule</h2>
 *
 * Every read here returns the last value the server sent, even while disconnected, and reports
 * {@link #connected()} false. It never returns null and never blanks a readout. That is deliberate
 * and it is an accessibility decision as much as a UX one: a HUD that empties when the network hiccups
 * removes information from a player mid-decision, and {@code docs/client/01-visual-language.md} §2.2.8
 * gives stale values their own visual state precisely so they can be shown rather than hidden.
 *
 * <h2>Refused and unreachable are different, all the way down</h2>
 *
 * A refusal comes back as {@code 1} with the server's reason. An unreachable server comes back as
 * {@code 69} — {@code EX_UNAVAILABLE} — and a sent-but-unanswered request as {@code 75}. §9.4 requires
 * that "the server refused this" and "we could not reach the server" never collapse into one message,
 * and giving them different numbers is what makes that structural rather than a matter of copywriting
 * discipline. This class is where that distinction is actually produced.
 *
 * <h2>Status: the transport is not wired</h2>
 *
 * <strong>This implementation holds the shape and refuses every intent with {@code EX_UNAVAILABLE}.</strong>
 * The REST client, the AT Proto OAuth flow and the reconnect loop are <b>CL-8</b> in
 * {@code docs/design/15-open-questions.md} and are not built. Shipping the class in this state is
 * deliberate: it makes the port's two-implementation shape real and checkable, it lets the UI be
 * written against a disconnected session today, and it means the day the transport lands, no view
 * changes. What it must never become is a class that pretends to have data it does not have.
