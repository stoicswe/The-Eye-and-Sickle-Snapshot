/**
 * The whole screen: one undecorated Stage, four regions, and a desk in the middle.
 *
 * <h2>The four regions §3 specifies</h2>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   TOP STATUS STRIP  — operator, heat, noise, load, thermal, balance, session clock
 *   RAIL (34px)       — vertical label, launcher, minimised windows, hazard texture
 *   DESK              — the in-game window manager ({@link DeskManager})
 *   COMMAND STRIP     — prompt, live input, blinking caret, keybind hints
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>There is no OS title bar (§0, §10 criterion 1), so the top strip is also the Stage's drag
 * handle and carries its {@code [−] [□] [×]}. That keeps §3's region count exact rather than adding
 * a fifth band for window controls — and it is the honest arrangement anyway, since on this deck the
 * game window and the top readout are the same object.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing is hidden</h2>
 *
 * §3: "No hamburgers, no modals, no collapsed drawers, no tooltips carrying information not shown
 * elsewhere." Tooltips exist in this class but only ever <em>expand</em> something already on screen
 * — the heat chip's consequence text explains the band that is already displayed, which
 * {@code docs/client/07-accessibility.md} §5.2 requires anyway.
 *
 * <h2>The rail became the launcher, which settles §11 question 3</h2>
 *
 * The design language leaves the rail as "pure texture" and notes it "may want to become the window
 * switcher / running-tool list". It does, for a reason outside that document: every tool must be
 * reachable without the terminal (client pillar <b>C1</b>). Each rail entry shows the tool's
 * accelerator key, so the launcher teaches the shortcut while being the thing that replaces needing
 * it. The hazard strip and tick marks stay, so the texture argument survives too.
