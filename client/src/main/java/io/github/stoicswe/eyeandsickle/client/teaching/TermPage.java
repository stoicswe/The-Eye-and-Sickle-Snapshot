/**
 * One manual page, parsed from a term file.
 *
 * <h2>The shape is a real man page, and that is the whole educational bet</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/client/04-terminology-and-education.md} §4.3.1 fixes the section set against
 * {@code man-pages(7)}: {@code NAME}, {@code SYNOPSIS}, {@code DESCRIPTION}, {@code OPTIONS},
 * {@code EXIT STATUS}, {@code SEE ALSO} are real sections in the real order. Two are game additions
 * — {@code REAL-WORLD COUNTERPART} and {@code FURTHER READING} — and they are <em>visually marked as
 * such</em>, because a player who later opens a real man page and finds no counterpart section should
 * not conclude their memory is faulty.
 *
 * <p>By the time somebody has played for a while they will have read several hundred of these. When
 * they open a real one, they will already know where to look. That is the cheapest transferable skill
 * in the client and it costs nothing but keeping the shape honest.
 *
 * <h2>{@code NAME} is not stored</h2>
 *
 * It is derived from {@link #name()} and {@link #gloss()}, and {@code SEE ALSO} from {@link #seeAlso()}.
 * §4.3.1 requires the {@code NAME} line and the gloss bar to be the same string — one source, two
 * surfaces — and the only way to guarantee that is to have one source.
