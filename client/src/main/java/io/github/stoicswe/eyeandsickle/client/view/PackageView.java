/**
 * The package installer — what is in this thing, who made it, and is it what it says it is.
 *
 * <h2>Why installing gets a panel instead of a menu item that just does it</h2>
 *
 * Installing consumes the package, and a {@code .upg} is an <b>asset</b>: it can be sold instead, and
 * for an upgrade already owned it is worth strictly more sold than installed. That is a decision, and
 * a decision made from a right-click menu is a decision made without the facts. The panel puts the
 * facts where the action is — what it installs, what it will reserve when equipped, what gate it sits
 * behind, and whether anything is currently holding it.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The two digests are shown, not reduced to a tick</h2>
 *
 * {@link PackageManifest#expectedSha} is what the manifest declares and {@link
 * PackageManifest#actualSha} is what the payload hashes to. <b>Both</b> are printed, in full-width
 * monospace, above a verdict — because the point of a checksum is that a person compares two figures,
 * and a panel that only ever showed "verified ✓" would teach a player to trust a tick mark rather
 * than to read a digest. They always agree today; the mismatch state is built, styled and tested
 * because the player-to-player market in online play is where a payload can stop matching its
 * manifest, and a verification step that arrived at the same moment as the threat would be a new
 * mechanic nobody had a habit for.
 *
 * <h2>Two modes, one panel</h2>
 *
 * {@link Mode#INSTALL} carries the action. {@link Mode#INSPECT} is the same facts with no action at
 * all — the safe way to look at something you have not decided about. Sharing the panel is deliberate:
 * a separate read-only viewer would be a second place for the same six fields to be formatted, and
 * the day they disagreed the one showing the digest would be the one nobody trusted.
