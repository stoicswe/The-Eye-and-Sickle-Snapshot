/**
 * The target, drawn: a cutaway elevation of the thing being broken into.
 *
 * <h2>It is a meter, not a picture of one</h2>
 *
 * The tower is a stack of horizontal bands, <b>layer 0 at the bottom</b> because that is the one the
 * player stands on first and everything above it is still sealed. Each band's fill states its
 * outcome, the active band is framed heavier and carries a rotating texture in its own class's
 * character, and the plinth under the tower is a strike gauge. Every mark on it is a readout of
 * something in {@code BreachSnapshot}; nothing here is invented for atmosphere.
 *
 * <p>That is the whole argument for it existing under D-6. {@code docs/client/01-visual-language.md}
 * §7.3 forbids "anything at all while a breach is live, beyond the meters themselves", and the
 * amendment permits motion "if and only if the motion is itself the readout". The texture rotates on
 * exactly the band that is live and on no other; the scan marker travels the height of the tower
 * that is actually open. Stop the breach and both stop.
 *
 * <h2>Depth from glyph weight</h2>
 *
 * Four fills, four weights, in the order a player experiences them: {@code ▓} sealed, the class
 * texture while live, {@code ░} cleared, {@code ▒} bypassed, {@code █} locked. The distinction
 * survives greyscale, a monochrome phosphor palette and the high-visibility theme — which matters
 * more here than anywhere else in the client, because a player reading this panel is deciding
 * whether to spend attention or walk away.
 *
 * <h2>Ink, and the one place alarm is spent</h2>
 *
 * §2.1 rations alarm to twice per screen and D-7 rations amber to <em>one</em> element in the entire
 * feature, which is not on this panel. So the viewport has exactly two levels of grey and one alarm
 * use: {@link LayerOutcome#LOCKED}. A locked layer ends the attempt, so it is hostile state by the
 * strictest reading, and it can never appear twice in a live breach — the first one resolves it.
 *
 * <h2>An idle instrument holds still</h2>
 *
 * {@link #advance()} returns without touching the grid when there is no active layer. That is
 * {@code CoreCage}'s rule verbatim and it is the difference between a gauge and a screensaver: a
 * still viewport has told the player something true — nothing is open — before they read a word of
 * it. Under reduced motion {@link Pulse#animate} never fires again after construction, so the
 * widget holds whichever frame {@link #show} last painted; there is nothing extra to write, because
 * every render is complete in itself and no state is carried across frames except the phase.
