/**
 * The map window — the network in two views, and every network action reachable from either.
 *
 * <h2>Two views, one map, one toggle</h2>
 *
 * The brief asks for both surfaces because they answer different questions and neither answers the
 * other's. The <b>graph</b> shows shape: what is adjacent to what, how far from the vantage, where a
 * bridge leaves the server. The <b>list</b> shows everything: a generated server carries up to fifty
 * machines, and there is a density at which a picture stops being readable and a table does not.
 * They are fed from a single {@link NetMap} read per refresh — one call, one instance, handed to
 * both — so it is not possible for the two to disagree about what has been discovered.
 *
 * <h2>The server strip never scrolls away</h2>
 *
 * "The graph always shows the server the player is currently connected to" is a requirement, so it
 * is met structurally rather than by remembering to put it somewhere. The strip and the controls are
 * fixed chrome inside the panel and only the data area scrolls — the same reasoning that made the
 * deck's compute readout a cell in the top strip rather than a widget on the desk: chrome has no
 * z-order to lose and nothing to hide behind.
 *
 * <p>⚠ The data area scrolls <b>horizontally</b>, which is the one place this panel departs from the
 * house rule that a deck panel reflows to its width. Both views are character-cell textures: a
 * fourteen-column node cell and a fixed-width table cannot reflow without ceasing to line up, and a
 * table whose columns move is a table a player cannot read down. So the scroll is on the data area
 * only, and the panel around it still reflows.
 *
 * <h2>Bound to the port, and to nothing else</h2>
 *
 * Every number, name and state on this panel arrives through {@link GameSession}. The view never
 * asks the solo engine anything and holds no rule of its own — it does not decide whether a sweep is
 * affordable, whether a foothold exists, or what a node's type is. When an action is refused, the
 * refusal printed is the one the rules gave. That is Invariant <b>I14</b> at the panel where it
 * would be easiest to break, and the consequence worth stating is the same one the breach window
 * has: this window works unchanged against a home server, because it cannot tell the difference.
 *
 * <h2>The sweep ladder shows the rules' verdict, and does not compute one</h2>
 *
 * All three rungs are always <b>offered</b>. The two the player has not bought read as
 * {@code LOCKED}, dimmed, with a tooltip naming the tool and its price and stating what the tier
 * buys over the base — {@code docs/client/05} §5's rule that a gate is never a generic "locked".
 *
 * <p>⚠ That verdict arrives through {@link GameSession#sweepOptions()} and is <b>never</b> worked
 * out here. A panel that decided a sweep was locked by looking for an item id in the inventory would
 * be a second implementation of {@code NetRules.owns} living in a view, and the day the rule grows a
 * second condition the window is the one that lies. A rung the port does not mention is drawn as it
 * always was — offered, with the rules free to refuse it — because an absent verdict is not a locked
 * one. See {@link #paintSweepLadder}, which also records why the control is marked rather than
 * {@code setDisable}d.
 *
 * <h2>The subscription is closed</h2>
 *
 * {@code MoreViews} discards the {@link AutoCloseable} that {@code onChange} returns, in five
 * windows, so a closed panel keeps being called back for the life of the session. This one holds the
 * handle and closes it — together with the graph's animation subscription — when the node leaves the
 * scene, which is what {@code DeskManager.close} does to it. Minimising only sets a window
 * invisible and leaves it in the desk, so a minimised map keeps updating, which is correct: it is
 * still open.
