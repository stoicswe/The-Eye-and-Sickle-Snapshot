/**
 * Everything the rig readout shows, derived once.
 *
 * <h2>Why derivation lives here and not in three views</h2>
 *
 * The strip, the rig-monitor panel and the terminal's {@code ps} all want the same figures. Deriving
 * them in each place is three chances to derive them differently — and a HUD whose two halves
 * disagree about the income rate is worse than one that shows neither, because
 * {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.1 trains the player to treat a discrepancy as evidence.
 *
 * <h2>What this is allowed to compute, and what it is not</h2>
 *
 * Client pillar <b>C4</b> forbids the client claiming authority it does not have: no gate evaluation,
 * no loot rolls, no optimistic outcomes. It does <em>not</em> forbid arithmetic on published rates —
 * {@code docs/client/04} §3.4 explicitly endorses "printing the numbers and letting the player do
 * the arithmetic", and the mining window has always shown a projected EC/hr.
 *
 * <p>The line this holds: everything here is a <b>rate or a posture derived from a published
 * constant and current state</b>. Nothing here decides whether an action will succeed, whether a
 * gate opens, or what a balance is. The balance comes from the session. The projection is labelled
 * as a projection.
