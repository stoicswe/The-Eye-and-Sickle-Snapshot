 * Builds, caches and applies the client's pointers.
 *
 * <h2>Three measured facts this class is built around</h2>
 *
 * All three were measured against JavaFX 26.0.2 on this project, not read from a tutorial. Two of
 * them contradict what web CSS would lead you to expect, which is the fourth and fifth time this
 * codebase has hit that.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>{@code -fx-cursor: url(...)} does not work.</b> It parses and then fails at apply time
 *       with {@code ClassCastException: java.lang.String incompatible with javafx.scene.Cursor}. A
 *       custom cursor therefore <em>cannot</em> come from a stylesheet — it must be set from Java.
 *   <li><b>A CSS {@code -fx-cursor} on a node beats an inherited Scene cursor.</b> Measured: with
 *       {@code scene.setCursor(custom)}, a Label reads {@code getCursor() == null} (inheriting) until
 *       a stylesheet gives it {@code -fx-cursor: hand}, after which it reads {@code HAND}. So every
 *       {@code -fx-cursor} declaration left in {@code theme.css} would punch a system-cursor hole in
 *       the skin. They were removed; {@link #clickable} replaces them.
 *   <li><b>A hotspot outside the image is clamped, not rejected.</b> {@code new ImageCursor(img32,
 *       42, 42)} yields a hotspot of {@code 31,31}. Safe, but it means a wrong hotspot fails
 *       silently rather than loudly.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Colours come from the stylesheet, not from here</h2>
 *
 * See {@link Palette}. The upshot is that switching to phosphor or to high-visibility re-draws the
 * pointer in that palette's accent, with no colour constant anywhere in Java —
 * {@code UiContractTest} enforces the absence.
 *
 * <h2>HiDPI</h2>
 *
 * JavaFX offers no @2x mechanism for cursors: {@code ImageCursor.getBestSize} on macOS returns
 * whatever you pass it, and the image is used at its natural size in points. On a 2× display
 * (measured: {@code Screen.getPrimary().getOutputScaleX() == 2.0}) a 32-point cursor is therefore
 * drawn from 32 pixels and is slightly soft. Every skin is drawn on half-pixel coordinates with
 * 1px strokes to keep that as crisp as the platform allows; the alternative — a 64px image — would
 * be a physically double-sized pointer, which is worse.
