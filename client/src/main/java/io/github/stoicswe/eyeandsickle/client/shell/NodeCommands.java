/**
 * The commands that run <em>on a machine</em> rather than on the client.
 *
 * <h2>Why a second catalogue and not more entries in {@link BuiltinCommands}</h2>
 *
 * Every command in {@code BuiltinCommands} answers a question about the player's own position —
 * {@code ps} is <em>your</em> compute, {@code ledger} is <em>your</em> money. These all take a
 * machine as an implied subject: {@code ls} means "list on the box this window is attached to". A
 * single registry would need every command to carry a target it mostly ignores, and the first time
 * somebody forgot, a command meant for a foreign host would quietly answer about the player's rig.
 * Two registries make the subject structural.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Every command carries its own options as DATA</h2>
 *
 * {@link NodeCommand#options()} is not documentation. It is what the shell window's right-click
 * builder reads to offer a command's flags with the values they accept, and it is what
 * {@link #run} parses. One source: a flag that exists is offerable, and a flag that is offered
 * runs. The alternative — a menu written by hand beside a parser written by hand — is two lists that
 * agree on the day they are written and never again.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing here decides anything</h2>
 *
 * Listings, readability and refusals all come from {@link GameSession}. This class formats. When a
 * file cannot be read, the {@code readable} flag that says so was set by the rules (I14) — a shell
 * that worked out permissions itself would be answering the one question the authoritative side
 * exists to answer.
