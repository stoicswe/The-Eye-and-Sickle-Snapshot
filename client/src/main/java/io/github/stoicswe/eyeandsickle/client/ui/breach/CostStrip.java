/**
 * The legal moves, each with its price on its face.
 *
 * <h2>§4's requirement, in its stronger form</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/05-hacking-minigame.md} §4 asks that attention be "visible and itemised at all
 * times". The ledger is the itemised half. This is the visible half, and it goes one step further
 * than the doc asks: <b>every chip prints its cost whether or not the player can afford it</b>. A
 * cost that only appears when it is payable teaches the player nothing about the shape of the
 * choice, and the whole loud-versus-patient trade the class is built on is a comparison between two
 * numbers the player has to be able to see side by side.
 *
 * <p>The cost is on the {@link BreachAction} rather than computed here, which is Invariant I14 doing
 * its job: a tarpit surcharge, a firewall penalty and a loadout discount all move the price, and a
 * client that recomputed any of that would be a second implementation of a balance rule sitting
 * where a cheater can reach it. The engine sends the number; this draws it.
 *
 * <h2>Kind before cost</h2>
 *
 * The chip's class is keyed to {@link BreachActionKind}, so <em>how loud this is</em> is legible
 * before the digits are read — a quiet read is dim, a probe is body weight, a loud tool is bright,
 * a bypass carries an alarm-coloured border. That ordering matches how a player actually decides:
 * they choose a register first and a specific move second.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Labels, not Buttons</h2>
 *
 * The same call {@code WindowFrame} makes for its window controls, for the same measured reason:
 * Modena's {@code .button} brings its own padding, its own focus ring and its own background insets,
 * none of which survive contact with a design language whose corner radius is zero everywhere. A
 * {@link Label} plus {@code es-focusable} plus explicit Space/Enter handling is the whole of what a
 * button is here, and it is fully keyboard-reachable — which a {@code setOnMouseClicked}-only chip
 * would not be, and which {@code docs/client/07-accessibility.md} requires.
 *
 * <h2>Preview fires on focus as well as hover</h2>
 *
 * Hover-only cost preview is a mouse feature. Focus fires it too, so a player driving the breach
 * from the keyboard gets the same forewarning — and the refusal string is set as accessible text as
 * well as tooltip text, because JavaFX tooltips are mouse-only and a refusal nobody can read is a
 * dead control.
