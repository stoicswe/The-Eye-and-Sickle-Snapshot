/**
 * Text the player reads, looked up by key, with English underneath.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ What is translatable here, and what must never be</h2>
 *
 * This is the line the whole design turns on, and getting it wrong would damage the thing the client
 * exists for. <b>Command names, flag names and page names are code, not text.</b> {@code ls} is
 * {@code ls} in every locale; {@code --verbose} is {@code --verbose}; {@code grep(1)} is
 * {@code grep(1)}. Three reasons, in increasing order of importance:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The parser is a closed AST over an enumerated registry. A localised verb is a verb the
 *       parser does not have.
 *   <li>Real Unix does not localise them either, so translating them would be inventing a behaviour
 *       and presenting it as the real one.
 *   <li>Pillar <b>C6</b> and the whole of {@code docs/education/} sell <em>transferable</em> skill —
 *       a player who learns {@code grep -v} here can use it tonight. A localised flag takes that
 *       away from precisely the players a translation is for, which makes it worse than no
 *       translation at all.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>So: <b>structure is code, prose is text.</b> A command declares which flags it has and what
 * shape they are; this supplies the sentence describing them.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Fallback is per KEY, not per file</h2>
 *
 * A partial translation is the normal state of a translation — someone renders forty strings and the
 * next forty arrive a month later. Falling back per file would mean a bundle with one missing key
 * drops the player into English wholesale; falling back per key means they get their language for
 * everything that has been done and English for the rest, which is what every real localised program
 * does and the only behaviour that lets a translation ship incrementally.
 *
 * <p>⚠ A key with no entry <b>anywhere</b> returns the key itself rather than blank or null. A blank
 * label is invisible and a null is a crash; a key on screen is ugly, obviously wrong, and tells
 * whoever sees it exactly which entry to add.

     *
     * {@code WindowSpec} carries its own English title and description, and a test asserts that table
     * against {@code docs/client/05}. Copying those strings into {@code windows_en.properties} would
     * make two English sources for one sentence, and the copy is the one that would rot — nothing
     * would notice the day somebody edited the enum and not the file.
     *
     * <p>So English stays where it is and a translation is an <b>overlay</b>: callers ask with
     * {@link #get(String, String)}, passing the code's own string as the fallback. No English bundle
     * is expected, and its absence is not a problem to report.
     *
     * <p>⚠ The distinction from {@link #load} is which side owns English. Use {@code load} when the
     * bundle is the only place the sentence exists (the command schema); use this when the code
     * already holds it.
