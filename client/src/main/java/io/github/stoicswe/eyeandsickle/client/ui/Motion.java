/**
 * The only two animations in the client that are not a {@link Pulse} subscription.
 *
 * <h2>{@link Interpolator#DISCRETE}, everywhere, without exception</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/ui-design-language.md} §5: "Any spring, bounce, or ease-out reads as web UI
 * immediately and will undo the whole aesthetic." §9 lists easing curves as build-blocking, and §10
 * criterion 7 makes it checkable: <b>no {@code Interpolator.EASE_*} appears anywhere in the
 * codebase.</b> {@code MotionTest} greps the source tree for exactly that, because this is the kind
 * of rule that survives review nine times and then loses to one plausible "just this dialog".
 *
 * <p>{@link Interpolator#LINEAR} is permitted and is used in exactly one place —
 * {@link io.github.stoicswe.eyeandsickle.client.ui.widgets.SweepPanel}, which §5 specifies as a
 * linear loop.
 *
 * <p>⚠ There is now a second family of continuous motion, and it is deliberately <em>not</em> here:
 * {@link Fade} and {@link PowerOn} ramp per frame off an {@code AnimationTimer}. §5.1 permits that
 * on the power-on splash and nowhere else, and {@code UiContractTest} rations {@code AnimationTimer}
 * by filename for the same reason it rations {@code Interpolator.LINEAR}. Nothing in this class
 * changed; what changed is that "the client has no continuous animation" is no longer true, so do
 * not read the paragraph below as one.
 *
 * <h2>Why the reveal is a clip and not an opacity fade</h2>
 *
 * §5 gives the panel reveal as "horizontal clip wipe, ~0.34s, 9 discrete steps". A fade would be a
 * continuous interpolation of a continuous property — and it would also read as a web page loading.
 * A wipe in nine jumps reads as a raster being drawn by something with a fixed refresh, which is the
 * intended illusion.
 *
 * <p>That argument is about a <b>panel</b>, and it still holds: a panel that fades in makes the
 * player wait to read it. §5.1's carve-out is for the splash, where nothing is readable, nothing is
 * interactive and nothing is being measured. The line is <em>motion the player works inside</em>
 * versus <em>motion they only watch</em>, not the property being animated.
