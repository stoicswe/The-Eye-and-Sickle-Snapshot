/**
 * Slide-in notices for things that finished, and things that went wrong.
 *
 * <h2>It is the log, filtered — not a second source of truth</h2>
 *
 * Every notice here is a {@link GameSession.LogLine} the rig already emitted. Nothing has its own
 * message, its own severity, or its own idea of what happened. That matters more than it sounds:
 * a notification system with its own copy of the events is one that can disagree with the log, and
 * {@code docs/design/04-mining.md} §3.1 makes noticing that two readouts disagree the way a player
 * catches a hidden miner. If the toast and the log can differ, that skill stops working.
 *
 * <p>It also means the filter is already meaningful. The log uses real RFC 5424 severities, so
 * "which notifications do I want" is a severity threshold — exactly {@code journalctl -p}'s
 * semantics, and the same habit the manual teaches. A player who sets it to <b>4</b> gets warnings
 * and worse, which is a sentence that is true of this game and of every Linux box they will ever
 * touch.
 *
 * <h2>Not a modal, and allowed to be missed</h2>
 *
 * §3 bans hidden UI and modals; a toast is neither. It never blocks, it never demands a click, and
 * <b>everything it says is permanently available in the log window</b> — which is precisely the
 * condition §3 sets for a transient surface. A player who ignores every notice loses nothing.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * The slide is {@link Interpolator#DISCRETE} in {@link UiTokens#REVEAL_STEPS} steps, like every
 * other movement in this client. §9 lists easing curves as build-blocking, and a toast easing in
 * from the right is the single most recognisable piece of web-app furniture there is — it would
 * undo the aesthetic on its own. Under reduced motion notices appear in place and hold.
