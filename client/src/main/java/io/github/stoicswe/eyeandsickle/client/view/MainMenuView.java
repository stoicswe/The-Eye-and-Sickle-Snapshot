/**
 * The main menu — a login screen.
 *
 * <h2>Why a menu at all, when the client used to open straight into a game</h2>
 *
 * Because there are now three characters and two modes, and the moment a player has more than one of
 * anything, "which one?" is a question the software has to ask rather than assume. It is also the one
 * place in the client where stopping the player is <em>free</em> — they are not mid-breach, nothing is
 * on a timer, and nothing is at stake — which makes it the right place for the two questions that are
 * awkward everywhere else: which character, and how much explanation do you want.
 *
 * <h2>macOS's user picker over GDM's furniture ({@code ui-design-language.md} §3.1)</h2>
 *
 * A row of round faces with a name under each, and the system controls in a bottom bar. Both halves
 * say the same thing, which is the thing this screen is for: <b>the question is "who", and everything
 * else is chrome.</b> §3's tiling rule does not reach here — see §3.1 for why, and for what the
 * stacked column of slot cards this replaced was getting wrong.
 *
 * <p>⚠ The pictures are the ones the operators actually have, generated silhouettes included — which
 * is what makes them worth showing. Three characters called {@code kyy}, {@code kyyr} and
 * {@code kyyrell} are indistinguishable in a list and instantly different as faces.
 *
 * <h2>CL-4 / T-2, answered here</h2>
 *
 * The teaching layer defaults to {@code explain}, which is right for the audience the education goal
 * targets and wrong for a player who already knows Unix. The open question asked for a first-run
 * familiarity prompt and worried about the onboarding cost. On this screen there is no onboarding
 * cost: the player is already stopped, choosing something. It is asked once, it is answerable in one
 * click, and {@code teach} changes it later at any time.
 *
 * <h2>What the home-server face does and does not claim</h2>
 *
 * It says what is and is not wired, before taking an address rather than after. ⚠ The rule that
 * survives from when nothing worked: <strong>a field that accepts input and then fails teaches the
 * player to distrust the address they typed</strong>, which is worse than the missing feature. So the
 * prompt now names the split — sign-in and account state work; mining, the chain, breach and the
 * filesystem are not authoritative server-side yet (<b>CL-8</b>,
 * {@code docs/architecture/13-the-game-transport.md}) — rather than claiming either that everything
 * works or that nothing does.
