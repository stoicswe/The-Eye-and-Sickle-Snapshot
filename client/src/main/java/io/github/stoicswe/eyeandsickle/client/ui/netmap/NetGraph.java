/**
 * The player's machine and the network next to it, drawn as a character graph.
 *
 * <h2>What this panel is for</h2>
 *
 * The brief that produced it is blunt: discovery is unusable at the start, and a new player needs a
 * <b>network diagram</b> of the machines adjacent to their own. So this is the headline surface —
 * the answer to "what is next to me" — and the exhaustive list beside it is the reference, not the
 * picture. With up to fifty machines on a server that split is the honest one, and the panel says so
 * when a column has to clamp.
 *
 * <p>Columns are hop distance from the vantage, which is the same unit the rules are written in:
 * reach is a hard ceiling raised only by a schematic-gated tool (Invariant I2 — schematics buy reach,
 * ethecoin buys sensitivity), so a column is literally one purchase of reach away, and moving the
 * vantage by taking a foothold is the other way to cross one. See {@link NetLayout}.
 *
 * <h2>An undiscovered machine is drawn nowhere at all</h2>
 *
 * No cell, no placeholder, no {@code ··}, no "3 contacts nearby". A machine the player has not
 * detected has no {@code Sighting}, so there is nothing here to leak even by accident. The one thing
 * drawn outside the discovered set is a bridge's {@code ··} stub, which carries the peer
 * <em>server's name</em> and nothing else — that is the single fact a bridge exists to publish.
 *
 * <p>{@code ░░} is not a leak either, and the distinction is worth holding on to: it means "detected,
 * type not established", which is exactly what a sweep sells. Turning it into {@code ▒▒ TERMINAL} is
 * what the 15 EC Passive Sniffer sells.
 *
 * <h2>Structure: a Label per node cell, and the reason it is not one Label for the map</h2>
 *
 * Copied from {@code LatticeMap}, which is the only pattern in this codebase that gives per-node hit
 * testing, tooltips, keyboard focus and per-node accessible text on an ASCII graph — and this map
 * needs all four, because clicking a node is how a player targets one. The routing underneath is
 * computed as a <em>single</em> grid by {@link NetCanvas} and then sliced into those Labels, so a
 * lane that crosses a column boundary still merges correctly; per-column routing is what would let
 * two edges silently erase each other at the seam.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * One {@code ·} steps along the vantage's outbound run, one cell per {@code NET_PACKET_MS} tick,
 * through {@link Pulse#animate} — decoration, so reduced motion freezes it — and it holds still
 * outright when there is no vantage or nothing leaves it. A map that keeps pulsing at a dead end
 * would be lying, which is {@code CoreCage}'s rule and {@code LatticeMap}'s after it.

     * A full rebuild every {@code NET_PACKET_MS} replaces every node cell three times a second, and a
     * replaced {@code Label} is one that has lost keyboard focus — so a player tabbing across the map
     * would be thrown back to the start of the traversal order before they could press SPACE, and a
     * screen reader would be re-announcing a cell that never moved. §4.8 requires per-node keyboard
     * focus; decoration does not get to take it away, which is the same rule that keeps the packet off
