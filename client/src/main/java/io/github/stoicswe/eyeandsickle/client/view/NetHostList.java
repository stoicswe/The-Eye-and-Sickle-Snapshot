/**
 * The exhaustive list of everything the player has discovered.
 *
 * <h2>Why the list is rebuilt rather than kept</h2>
 *
 * The window that shipped before this one rendered known nodes into a raw {@code TableView} styled
 * with {@code es-panel-title}, {@code es-mono}, {@code es-text-secondary}, {@code es-state-refused}
 * and {@code es-state-unreachable} — <b>none of which {@code theme.css} declares</b>. A style class
 * the stylesheet does not know about is not an error: JavaFX applies nothing and the control renders
 * at Modena's defaults while the Java reads as though it were themed. So the old list looked
 * deliberate in source and was, on screen, the one panel in the client outside the design language.
 * Rebuilding it is cheaper than retrofitting a {@code TableView} that {@code ui-design-language.md}
 * §9 rejects four ways over (radius, shadow, gradient, proportional type).
 *
 * <h2>The list is the exhaustive surface; the graph is the legible one</h2>
 *
 * A server may hold up to fifty machines and the generated world up to seven servers, so there is a
 * density at which a picture stops being readable and a table does not. That split is the design
 * rather than a limitation, and both halves of it are honest: the graph clamps a layer and says how
 * many it dropped, and this shows every row it is given, with no cap and no paging.
 *
 * <h2>What a row may say</h2>
 *
 * Everything printed here comes from {@link NetText}, so the terminal's {@code net} and this panel
 * cannot drift apart — see that class for why that matters and for the two things a row is not
 * allowed to infer. Nothing undiscovered appears at all: a node the sweep did not detect is absent
 * from {@link NetMap#sightings()}, and there is deliberately no count, no placeholder and no
 * "3 contacts nearby" to hint that it exists.
 *
 * <h2>Rows are only rebuilt when their text changes</h2>
 *
 * The discipline the removed {@code BreachTargetList} also followed: the session fires a change on
 * most ticks, and
 * rebuilding a list of focusable labels on each of those would drop keyboard focus out from under
 * anyone tabbing through it. The rendered lines are the comparison key — exact, cheap, and true by
 * definition, because the lines <em>are</em> what the player can see.
