/**
 * A character grid painted into three overlaid monospace labels. The breach's drawing surface.
 *
 * <h2>Extracted from {@code CoreCage}, for the same reason it was written there</h2>
 *
 * Colour has to vary per character and JavaFX has no styled-text-run primitive cheaper than
 * {@link javafx.scene.text.TextFlow}. Because the face is monospace, overlaid {@link Label}s align
 * exactly — each carries the characters at its own ink level and spaces everywhere else, so the
 * three of them compose into one picture. Three nodes redrawn on a slow timer, instead of a node per
 * cell. {@code CoreCage} proved the mechanism with two levels; the breach needs a third, because a
 * locked layer is genuinely hostile state and {@code -es-alarm} is the only honest way to say so.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ This file is the glyph blast radius, and that is deliberate</h2>
 *
 * The implementation spec makes {@code AsciiCanvas} the only file in the breach package permitted to
 * carry box-drawing and block literals. That rule has been taken one step further here: <b>every
 * character the six breach widgets <em>draw</em> is a named constant below.</b> The only non-ASCII
 * literals left anywhere else in the package are three em dashes in player-facing prose, which are
 * punctuation rather than vocabulary and are present in both bundled faces.
 *
 * <p>The reason is {@code GlyphCoverageTest}. It parses the bundled TTF {@code cmap} and fails the
 * build on any character absent from IBM Plex Mono — and the characters a renderer reaches for by
 * reflex are exactly the ones that are missing. The Geometric Shapes block (U+25A0–U+25FF) has
 * <b>one</b> character in Plex, the lozenge; {@code ■ □ ▲ ● ◆ ►}, which is what a status marker, a
 * bullet and an arrow all want to be, are none of them present. Concentrating the vocabulary here
 * means the audit is one file and one {@code grep}, rather than seven files and a hope. Every
 * constant below was checked against the inventory in the implementation spec §7.2.
 *
 * <h2>Depth is glyph weight, never colour</h2>
 *
 * The palette has one accent and it is reserved (§2.1, and D-7 rations it to a single element in the
 * whole feature), so a render that wanted colour depth could not have it. Every state distinction
 * the breach draws is therefore carried by a <em>different character</em> first and an ink level
 * second: sealed is {@code ▓}, cleared is {@code ░}, bypassed is {@code ▒}, locked is {@code █}. A
 * player in greyscale, or one who cannot separate the grey ramp at all, reads the same picture.
