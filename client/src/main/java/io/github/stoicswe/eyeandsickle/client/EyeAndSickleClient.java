/**
 * The operator's client.
 *
 * <h2>It starts offline, and that is the default rather than a fallback</h2>
 *
 * The game opens a {@link LocalGameSession} over a {@link GameEngine}: no network, no account, no
 * database, no second process. {@code docs/design/00-vision-and-pillars.md} makes single player the
 * default mode, and the client honours that by being playable the moment it launches — the only I/O
 * it performs is reading and writing two JSON files in the profile directory.
 *
 * <h2>One undecorated Stage, and a window manager inside it</h2>
 *
 * Tools used to be separate {@link Stage}s. {@code docs/design/ui-design-language.md} §0 cancelled
 * that on 2026-07-26: native window chrome puts real macOS traffic lights and Windows title bars
 * around the game, and "the entire aesthetic depends on the player never seeing their own operating
 * system." What replaced it is {@link io.github.stoicswe.eyeandsickle.client.ui.DeckShell} — one
 * {@link javafx.stage.StageStyle#UNDECORATED} Stage containing a desk the client draws itself, with
 * drag, focus, z-order, snap-to-grid and edge tiling.
 *
 * <p>That is strictly more capable than either of the layouts it replaces, which is why the setting
 * that chose between them is gone rather than repointed. Window management under time pressure is
 * still a real barrier ({@code docs/client/07-accessibility.md}), and the answer is now the rail
 * launcher and the switcher rather than a second layout to maintain.
 *
 * <h2>What this class must never become</h2>
 *
 * A view and input layer. It renders session-owned state and sends intent; it decides nothing a
 * cheating client would want to forge (Invariant I14). In solo that distinction has no adversary, but
 * the code path is the same one online play uses — which is exactly why solo must not get its own.
 *
 * <h2>This class has no {@code main}, deliberately</h2>
 *
 * Start the client through {@link Launcher}. A {@code main} here would be a run arrow in every IDE
 * pointing at the one launch that cannot work: a main class extending {@link Application} makes the
 * JVM look for JavaFX on the module path before {@code main} runs, and a classpath launch then dies
 * with "JavaFX runtime components are missing" — an error that names the wrong problem entirely.
 * {@code Launcher}'s class comment has the full explanation.
