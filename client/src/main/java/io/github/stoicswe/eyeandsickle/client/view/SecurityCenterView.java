/**
 * SECURITY CENTER — what got in, what was supposed to stop it, and when to look again.
 *
 * <h2>The layout is a consumer security suite; the LOOK is not</h2>
 *
 * The structure is deliberately borrowed from the shape every real antivirus product has settled on,
 * because that shape is genuinely good and a player already knows how to read it: a section rail down
 * the left, one status card per subsystem, and a single loud verdict with one primary action beside
 * it. A player who has ever seen such a product knows what this window is for before reading a word.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ NONE of the reference's styling is reproduced, and that is not a shortfall</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/ui-design-language.md} §9 makes drop shadows, blur and glassmorphism
 * <b>build-blocking</b> — {@code UiContractTest} fails the build on {@code dropshadow(} anywhere in a
 * stylesheet — and rounded corners are an opt-in gated on {@code .es-rounded}. §2.1 bans a semantic
 * colour system and reserves amber and alarm for named meanings. So the soft gradients, the glowing
 * circular button and the blurred colour field are not available, and imitating them would be the
 * "competent dark-mode developer tool" failure §1 names, arrived at from the opposite direction.
 *
 * <p>What replaces them is this client's own vocabulary for the same jobs: a discrete cell meter
 * where the reference has a gradient ring, a stepped sparkline where it has a smooth one, a hazard
 * band where it has a coloured glow, and the verdict carried by <b>type size and position</b>
 * rather than by a halo. §4.4's rule does the work — state survives greyscale and reaches a screen
 * reader, which a glow never does.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ The verdict is the only place alarm is spent</h2>
 *
 * §2.1 rations {@code -es-alarm} to loss and hostile state and asks for at most twice a screen. A
 * security panel is exactly where that budget belongs, and it is spent on one thing: the headline,
 * when there is something to find. Everything else stays on the neutral ramp so the headline means
 * something when it changes.

        // maximum is set. So the column reported itself ~900px wide, the pair did not fit, and the
