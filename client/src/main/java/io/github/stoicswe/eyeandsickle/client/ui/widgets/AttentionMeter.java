/**
 * The attention budget, one cell per point.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is {@link CycleGrid}'s argument and not {@link CellMeter}'s</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/ui-design-language.md} §4 bans a continuous bar, and both widgets obey that. The
 * difference is what the number <em>is</em>. A cell meter's cells are a sampling of a quantity; this
 * one's cells <b>are</b> the quantity — attention is a small integer the player counts, spends two of
 * at a time, and decides on. "Fifteen left" is a number a player acts on; "68% remaining" is not. So
 * it is the cycle grid's rule: one cell per point, wrapped at {@link UiTokens#ATTENTION_CELLS_PER_ROW}.
 *
 * <h2>The lost cells are the point of the whole widget</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/05-hacking-minigame.md} §4 requires that a loss read as <em>"I was too loud"</em>
 * and never as <em>"the game decided"</em>. Attention spent on an alarm penalty is drawn in
 * {@code -es-alarm} at the end of the spent run, so the budget itself carries the history of how it
 * went — a player who ran out can see, without opening the ledger, how much of the shortfall was
 * moves and how much was noise. That is one of the two alarm uses this panel is allowed (§2.1 caps
 * it at two per screen; the other is the ledger's strike rows).
 *
 * <h2>The preview is the other half of §4's legibility requirement</h2>
 *
 * §4 asks for attention to be "visible and itemised at all times". Itemised after the fact is the
 * ledger; visible before the click is this — hovering or focusing an action chip lights the cells it
 * would consume, so the cost is answered in the same units and the same place as the balance. The
 * blink is a two-state <b>class swap</b> on {@link UiTokens#RECOVERY_BLINK_MS}, never an opacity
 * tween: §5 permits step timing only, and this is the same two-step loop the thermal-recovery cells
 * already use, so it lands on the same frames as the rest of the deck.
 *
 * <h2>⚠ Numbers snap</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/client/01-visual-language.md} §7.3: "No count-up, no roll, no odometer" on any numeric
 * readout, no exceptions. The caption is rebuilt whole on every call and there is nowhere for an
 * intermediate value to live.
