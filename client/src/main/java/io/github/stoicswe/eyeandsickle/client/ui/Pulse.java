/**
 * The one clock every animated thing on the deck runs from.
 *
 * <h2>One driver, not one per widget</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/ui-design-language.md} §7.3 is explicit: "All timers on one shared
 * {@code Timeline} driver, not one per widget." The deck has a caret, several greeble strips, a
 * sweep bar, recovery cells and a handful of twitching readouts on screen simultaneously — each of
 * which would otherwise be its own {@code INDEFINITE} {@code Timeline}, each with its own pulse
 * thread bookkeeping, none of them in phase. Sharing a driver also makes the recovery blink and the
 * caret land on the same frames, which is what makes the deck feel like one machine rather than
 * several widgets that happen to be adjacent.
 *
 * <h2>Reduced motion is a hard split, not a slow-down</h2>
 *
 * §5: "{@code prefers-reduced-motion} kills all of it — static final state, caret solid. Not
 * optional." So the two subscription kinds are genuinely different:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #every} — <b>data</b>. A session clock, a live figure. Runs regardless; suppressing
 *       it would not remove animation, it would remove information.
 *   <li>{@link #animate} — <b>decoration</b>. Greeble, blink, sweep. Under reduced motion these are
 *       invoked exactly once, so the widget paints its resting state and then holds still.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Note that reduced motion is a real OS preference JavaFX exposes — {@code
 * Platform.getPreferences().isReducedMotion()} — which {@code ThemeManager} already reads. (§10
 * criterion 8 asserts the toolkit cannot; that is the one factual error in the design language, and
 * it is corrected in the copy checked in here.)
