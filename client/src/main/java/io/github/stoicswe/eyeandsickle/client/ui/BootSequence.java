/**
 * The uOS boot log, played once when a character is opened.
 *
 * <h2>Why a loading screen is worth building at all</h2>
 *
 * Solo loads in milliseconds — there is nothing to wait for. So this is not a progress indicator
 * pretending to be one; it is the moment the game establishes that <em>you are sitting down at a
 * machine</em>. Every line it prints is real: the rig's actual capacity, its actual Thermal Budget,
 * Memory Buffer and Bandwidth, its actual balance and armed defences, read from the save that was
 * just opened. A boot log with invented specs would be the first thing the game told the player, and
 * it would be a lie.
 *
 * <p>That is also what makes it a teaching surface. {@code docs/client/04-terminology-and-education.md}
 * builds the client's vocabulary out of real Unix; a boot sequence is where a real machine tells you
 * what it found, and this one uses the same facility names the log uses and the same figures the rig
 * monitor will show thirty seconds later.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: typing, not fading</h2>
 *
 * §5: "Text arrival — types in character by character; never fades." Lines arrive one at a time on
 * the shared {@link Pulse} driver. There is no opacity tween anywhere in here, and the "monitor
 * warm-up" is not a fade either — it is a small number of discrete brightness steps applied as style
 * classes, which is the same trick {@link Motion#reveal} uses and the only kind of ramp §5 permits.
 *
 * <p>Under reduced motion the whole thing is skipped: the player gets the deck immediately. A boot
 * sequence is atmosphere, and §5 makes atmosphere the first thing to go.
 *
 * <h2>Skippable, always</h2>
 *
 * Any key or click ends it. A cutscene a player cannot skip is one they resent by the third time,
 * and this one plays on <em>every</em> load.
