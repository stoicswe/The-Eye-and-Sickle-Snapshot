/**
 * What the rig is doing right now — the Activity Monitor of the deck.
 *
 * <h2>Progress is counted, not swept</h2>
 *
 * {@code docs/design/ui-design-language.md} §4 is unambiguous about meters: "3px × 9px cells with 1px
 * gaps. <b>Never a continuous bar or gradient.</b>" So a task's progress is {@link CellMeter}, not a
 * {@link javafx.scene.control.ProgressBar} — and the reason is the same one behind
 * {@link CycleGrid}: a smooth bar implies a continuous quantity and invites a precision the model
 * does not have. Twenty cells of a thirty-second scan is a figure a player can read at a glance and
 * cannot over-read.
 *
 * <p>The exact remaining time sits beside it in words ({@code 04:12 LEFT}), because §6 asks for
 * units on every value and because {@code docs/client/07-accessibility.md} §5.2 forbids meaning that
 * rests on appearance alone — a meter with no number is a picture of progress rather than a report
 * of it.
 *
 * <h2>Unknown progress is shown as unknown</h2>
 *
 * {@link GameSession.RunningTask#progress()} returns a negative value when the start time was never
 * recorded — which happens on state written before the field existed. That is <b>not</b> zero, and
 * rendering it as an empty meter would tell the player a nearly-finished recovery had not started.
 * Those rows get the {@link SweepPanel} treatment instead: §5's linear sweep, which is the design
 * language's one signal for "in progress, duration unknown".
 *
 * <h2>Empty is an instruction</h2>
 *
 * §6: "Empty states are an instruction, not a mood piece." An idle rig says what would put something
 * here, rather than reporting that there is nothing here — which the player can already see.
